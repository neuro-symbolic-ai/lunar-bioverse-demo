It has been linked to prognosis and tamoxifen resistance. However, results have been ambiguous. The different functions of AIB1 in ER\u03b1-positive and -negative disease are poorly understood. Therefore, we analyzed the clinical significance of AIB1 in breast cancer with respect to ER\u03b1-status and characterized the subgroups. 2,197 breast carcinomas sampled on a pre-existing tissue microarray (TMA) were analyzed for AIB1 expression and amplification by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).AIB1 expression was detected in 60\u00a0% of the tumors. It was associated with tumor size (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003), high histological grade (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), poor disease-specific, and overall survival (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0018 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.003). There was a strong inverse relationship between AIB1 and ER\u03b1 expression (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). AIB1 overexpression was associated with increased Ki67 labeling index (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), even if analyzed for different ER expression levels. AIB1 amplification was found in 11\u00a0% of the carcinomas. It was associated with high histological grade (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0012), lymph node involvement (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0163), and poor disease-specific survival (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0032) but not with overall survival (p\u00a0=\u00a00.1672) or ER status (p\u00a0=\u00a00.4456). If ER-positive tumors were stratified according to their AIB1 amplification status, there was a significant worse disease-specific survival in cases showing AIB1 amplification (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0017). AIB1 expression is associated with unfavorable prognosis and tumor phenotype. It seems to unfold its oncogenic potential at least in part independent from its role as an ER\u03b1 co-activator. AIB1 has an impact on cell cycle regulation in ER\u03b1-positive as well as ER\u03b1-negative tumors. Furthermore, AIB1 amplification characterizes a subgroup of ER\u03b1-positive breast cancer with worse outcome. Therefore, AIB1 might be helpful to identify those ER\u03b1-positive breast cancers patients who are candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy.",

It has been linked to prognosis and tamoxifen resistance. However, results have been ambiguous. The different functions of AIB1 in ER\u03b1-positive and -negative disease are poorly understood. Therefore, we analyzed the clinical significance of AIB1 in breast cancer with respect to ER\u03b1-status and characterized the subgroups. 2,197 breast carcinomas sampled on a pre-existing tissue microarray (TMA) were analyzed for AIB1 expression and amplification by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).AIB1 expression was detected in 60\u00a0% of the tumors. It was associated with tumor size (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003), high histological grade (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), poor disease-specific, and overall survival (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0018 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.003). There was a strong inverse relationship between AIB1 and ER\u03b1 expression (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). AIB1 overexpression was associated with increased Ki67 labeling index (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), even if analyzed for different ER expression levels. AIB1 amplification was found in 11\u00a0% of the carcinomas. It was associated with high histological grade (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0012), lymph node involvement (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0163), and poor disease-specific survival (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0032) but not with overall survival (p\u00a0=\u00a00.1672) or ER status (p\u00a0=\u00a00.4456). If ER-positive tumors were stratified according to their AIB1 amplification status, there was a significant worse disease-specific survival in cases showing AIB1 amplification (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0017). AIB1 expression is associated with unfavorable prognosis and tumor phenotype. It seems to unfold its oncogenic potential at least in part independent from its role as an ER\u03b1 co-activator. AIB1 has an impact on cell cycle regulation in ER\u03b1-positive as well as ER\u03b1-negative tumors. Furthermore, AIB1 amplification characterizes a subgroup of ER\u03b1-positive breast cancer with worse outcome. Therefore, AIB1 might be helpful to identify those ER\u03b1-positive breast cancers patients who are candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy.",

While no specific mutations in BRCA1/2 have been reported in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), MPNST cells could be effectively targeted with a PARP inhibitor to drive cells to synthetic lethality due to their complex karyotype and high level of inherent genomic instability. In this study, we assessed the expression levels of PARP1 and PARP2 in MPNST patient tumor samples and correlated these findings with overall survival. We also determined the level of PARP activity in MPNST cell lines. In addition, we evaluated the efficacy of the PARP inhibitor AZD2281 (Olaparib) in MPNST cell lines. We observed decreased MPNST cell proliferation and enhanced apoptosis in vitro at doses similar to, or less than, the doses used in cell lines with established defective DNA repair genes. Furthermore, AZD2281 significantly reduced local growth of MPNST xenografts, decreased the development of macroscopic lung metastases, and increased survival of mice with metastatic disease. Our results suggest that AZD2281 could be an effective therapeutic option in MPNST and should be further investigated for its potential clinical use in this malignancy.",

To identify specific biomarkers of BCSCs, we have performed comparative proteomics of BCSC-enriched and mature cancer cell populations from the human breast cancer cell line (BCL), BrCA-MZ-01.ALDEFLUOR assay was used to sort BCSC-enriched (ALDH+) and mature cancer (ALDH-) cell populations. Total proteins were extracted from both fractions and subjected to 2-Dimensional Difference In-Gel Electrophoresis (2-D DIGE). Differentially-expressed spots were excised and proteins were gel-extracted, digested and identified using MALDI-TOF MS.2-D DIGE identified poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) as overexpressed in ALDH+ cells from BrCA-MZ-01. This observation was confirmed by western blot and extended to four additional human BCLs. ALDH+ cells from BRCA1-mutated HCC1937, which had the highest level of PARP1 overexpression, displayed resistance to olaparib, a specific PARP1 inhibitor.An unbiased proteomic approach identified PARP1 as upregulated in ALDH+, BCSC-enriched cells from various human BCLs, which may contribute to clinical resistance to PARP inhibitors.",

Xenograft model of a high PARP1 uterine leiomyosarcoma found trabectedin + olaparib significantly reduced tumor growth and halted the spread of metastasis (p<0.001 vs. single agents and control).

Trabectedin is an isoquinoline alkylating agent with a peculiar mechanism of action. It binds to minor groove of DNA inducing single- and double-strand-breaks. These kinds of damage lead to the activation of PARP1, a first-line enzyme in DNA-damage response pathways. We hypothesized that PARP1 targeting could perpetuate trabectedin-induced DNA damage in tumor cells leading finally to cell death.We investigated trabectedin and PARP1 inhibitor synergism in several tumor histotypes both in vitro and in vivo (subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor xenografts in mice). We searched for key determinants of drug synergism by comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and gene expression profiling (GEP) and validated their functional role.Trabectedin activated PARP1 enzyme and the combination with PARP1 inhibitors potentiated DNA damage, cell cycle arrest at G2/M checkpoint and apoptosis, if compared to single agents. Olaparib was the most active PARP1 inhibitor to combine with trabectedin and we confirmed the antitumor and antimetastatic activity of trabectedin/olaparib combination in mice models. However, we observed different degree of trabectedin/olaparib synergism among different cell lines. Namely, in DMR leiomyosarcoma models the combination was significantly more active than single agents, while in SJSA-1 osteosarcoma models no further advantage was obtained if compared to trabectedin alone. aCGH and GEP revealed that key components of DNA-repair pathways were involved in trabectedin/olaparib synergism. In particular, PARP1 expression dictated the degree of the synergism. Indeed, trabectedin/olaparib synergism was increased after PARP1 overexpression and reduced after PARP1 silencing.PARP1 inhibition potentiated trabectedin activity in a PARP1-dependent manner and PARP1 expression in tumor cells might be a useful predictive biomarker that deserves clinical evaluation.",

The gene is located at 9p21, a chromosome region often deleted in breast carcinomas, similar to CDKN2A, a recognized tumor suppressor gene. Several research groups have shown that MTAP acts as a tumor suppressor, and some therapeutic approaches were proposed based on a tumors\u00b4 MTAP status. We analyzed MTAP and CDKN2A gene (RT-qPCR) and protein (western-blotting) expression in seven breast cancer cell lines and evaluated their promoter methylation patterns to better characterize the contribution of these genes to breast cancer. Cytotoxicity assays with inhibitors of de novo adenine synthesis (5-FU, AZA and MTX) after MTAP gene knockdown showed an increased sensitivity, mainly to 5-FU. MTAP expression was also evaluated in two groups of samples from breast cancer patients, fresh tumors and paired normal breast tissue, and from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) core breast cancer samples diagnosed as Luminal-A tumors and triple negative breast tumors (TNBC). The difference of MTAP expression between fresh tumors and normal tissues was not statistically significant. However, MTAP expression was significantly higher in Luminal-A breast tumors than in TNBC, suggesting the lack of expression in more aggressive breast tumors and the possibility of using the new approaches based on MTAP status in TNBC.",

Very little is currently known about the mutations that drive aggressive cSCC.Whole-exome sequencing was performed on 39 cases of aggressive cSCC to identify driver genes and novel therapeutic targets. Significantly, mutated genes were identified with MutSig or complementary methods developed to specifically identify candidate tumor suppressors based upon their inactivating mutation bias.Despite the very high-mutational background caused by UV exposure, 23 candidate drivers were identified, including the well-known cancer-associated genes TP53, CDKN2A, NOTCH1, AJUBA, HRAS, CASP8, FAT1, and KMT2C (MLL3). Three novel candidate tumor suppressors with putative links to cancer or differentiation, NOTCH2, PARD3, and RASA1, were also identified as possible drivers in cSCC. KMT2C mutations were associated with poor outcome and increased bone invasion.The mutational spectrum of cSCC is similar to that of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and dominated by tumor-suppressor genes. These results improve the foundation for understanding this disease and should aid in identifying and treating aggressive cSCC.",

                      "abstract": "Estrogen receptor alpha (ER\u03b1) is a ligand-activated nuclear receptor that directs proliferation and differentiation in selected cancer cell types including mammary-derived carcinomas. These master-regulatory functions of ER\u03b1 require trans-acting elements such as the pioneer factor FOXA1 to establish a genomic landscape conducive to ER\u03b1 control. Here, we identify the H3K4 methyltransferase KMT2C as necessary for hormone-driven ER\u03b1 activity and breast cancer proliferation. KMT2C knockdown suppresses estrogen-dependent gene expression and causes H3K4me1 and H3K27ac loss selectively at ER\u03b1 enhancers. Correspondingly, KMT2C loss impairs estrogen-driven breast cancer proliferation but has no effect on ER- breast cells. Whereas KMT2C loss disrupts estrogen-driven proliferation, it conversely promotes tumor outgrowth under hormone-depleted conditions. In accordance, KMT2C is one of the most frequently mutated genes in ER-positive breast cancer with KMT2C deletion correlating with significantly shorter progression-free survival on anti-estrogen therapy. From a therapeutic standpoint, KMT2C-depleted cells that develop hormone-independence retain their dependence on ER\u03b1, displaying ongoing sensitivity to ER\u03b1 antagonists. We conclude that KMT2C is a key regulator of ER\u03b1 activity whose loss uncouples breast cancer proliferation from hormone abundance.",

                "0": "Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a rare and indolent cutaneous sarcoma, with the risk of aggressive fibro-sarcomatous transformation. Limited effective options are available for un-resectable or metastatic DFSP beyond targeting the oncogenic PDGF pathway with imatinib therapy. We established a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and cell line model (designated MDFSP-S1) of imatinib-resistant DFSP with fibro-sarcomatous transformation. Whole genome sequencing identified high-level amplification at chromosomes 17 and 22, whilst homozygous deep deletion was demonstrated at chromosome 9 (CDKN2A, CDKN2B, MTAP). RNA sequencing followed by Sanger sequencing confirmed the pathognomonic COL1A1-PDGFB t (17;22) rearrangement in the original tumour, PDX and cell line model. Immunohistochemistry profiles of the PDX model were consistent with the patient's tumour sample (CD34\u2009+\u2009/MIB1\u2009+\u2009/SOX10-\u2009). Gene set enrichment analysis highlighted top-scoring Hallmark gene sets in several oncogenic signalling pathways, including potentially targetable MTORC1 signalling and angiogenesis pathways. Antiangiogenic agents (sunitinib, regorafenib, pazopanib, axitinib) and the third-generation irreversible epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor osimertinib exhibited modest anti-proliferative activity in the cell line, with IC50 values between 1 and 10\u00a0\u00b5M at 72\u00a0h. No significant activity was observed with imatinib, palbociclib, everolimus, olaparib, gefitinib and erlotinib (IC50 all\u2009>\u200910\u00a0\u00b5M). In conclusion, we established MDFSP-S1, a new PDX and cell line model of imatinib-resistant DFSP with fibro-sarcomatous transformation.",
                "1": "We analyzed the oncogenic potential of RET \u0394898-901 mutant and its response to selpercatinib, vandetanib, and cabozantinib in vitro and in a clinical case. A 35-year-old man with a medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) harboring a somatic D898_E901 <i>RET</i> deletion was sequentially treated with vandetanib, selpercatinib, cabozantinib, and fluorouracil (5-FU)-dacarbazine. Functional study of RET \u0394898-901 mutant was performed in HEK-293T, NIH-3T3, and Ba/F3 cells. RET C634R and wild-type cells served as positive and negative controls, respectively. The patient showed primary resistance to vandetanib and secondary resistance to selpercatinib after 12 months. Comprehensive next-generation sequencing of a progressing lesion during selpercatinib showed no additional RET mutation but an acquired complete genetic loss of <i>CDKN2A</i>, <i>CDKN2B,</i> and <i>MTAP</i> genes. Subsequent treatment with cabozantinib and 5-FU-dacarbazine had poor efficacy. In vitro, RET \u0394898-901 showed higher ligand-independent RET autophosphorylation compared with RET C634R and similar proliferation rates in cell models. Subcutaneous injection of \u0394898-901 NIH 3T3 cells in nude mice produced tumors of around 500 mm<sup>3</sup> in 2 weeks, similarly to RET C634R cells. Selpercatinib inhibited cell growth of Ba/F3 RET \u0394898-901 and RET C634R with a similar half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of approximately 3 nM. Vandetanib was five-fold less effective at inhibiting cell growth promoted by RET \u0394898-901 mutant (IC<sub>50</sub>, 564 nM) compared with RET C634R one (IC<sub>50</sub>, 91 nM). Cabozantinib efficiently inhibited Ba/F3 RET C634 proliferation (IC<sub>50</sub>, 25.9 nM), but was scarcely active in Ba/F3 RET 898-901 (IC<sub>50</sub> > 1,350 nM). D898_E901 <i>RET</i> deletion is a gain-of-function mutation and responds to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in MTC. RET \u0394898-901 mutant is sensitive to selpercatinib and vandetanib, and acquired resistance to selpercatinib may develop via RET-independent mechanisms.",
                "2": "Lipoblastoma-like tumor (LLT) is a rare adipocytic neoplasm with a predilection for the vulva. Since 2002, <30 cases have been reported, characterizing it as an indolent tumor that may sometimes recur locally. Diagnosis can be challenging due to its rarity and morphologic overlap with other adipocytic tumors. Thus far, there are no specific molecular or immunohistochemical features to aid in the diagnosis of LLT. Recent case reports have described LLT arising at other sites, including the spermatic cord and gluteal region, suggesting wider anatomical distribution. We present a large series of LLT to further characterize its clinicopathologic and molecular features. Twenty-eight cases of LLT were retrieved from departmental and consult archives (including 8 from a prior series). The cohort comprised 28 patients (8 males, 20 females) with a median age of 28 years (range: 1-80 years). There were 17 primary LLT of the vulva. Other anatomical sites included the scrotum (n\u00a0= 3), spermatic cord (n\u00a0= 2), inguinal region (n\u00a0= 2), limbs (n\u00a0= 2), pelvis (n\u00a0= 1), and retroperitoneum (n\u00a0= 1). Median tumor size was 6.0 cm (range: 1.8-30.0 cm). The tumors had a lobulated architecture and were typically composed of adipocytes, lipoblasts, and spindle cells in a myxoid stroma with prominent thin-walled vessels. Using immunohistochemistry, a subset showed loss of Rb expression (12/23 of samples). Follow-up in 15 patients (median: 56 months) revealed 8 patients with local recurrence and 1 patient with metastases to the lung/pleura and breasts. Targeted DNA sequencing revealed a simple genomic profile with limited copy number alterations and low mutational burden. No alterations in RB1 were identified. The metastatic LLT showed concurrent pathogenic PIK3CA and MTOR activating mutations, both in the primary and in the lung/pleural metastasis; the latter also harbored TERT promoter mutation. One tumor had a pathogenic TSC1 mutation, and one tumor showed 2-copy deletion of CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and MTAP. No biologically significant variants were identified in 8 tumors. No gene fusions were identified by RNA sequencing in 4 tumors successfully sequenced. This study expands the clinicopathologic spectrum of LLT, highlighting its wider anatomical distribution and potential for occasional metastasis. Molecularly, we identified activating mutations in the PI3K-MTOR signaling pathway in 2 tumors, which may contribute to exceptional aggressive behavior.",
                "3": "Homozygous deletion of <i>MTAP</i> upregulates <i>de novo</i> synthesis of purine (DNSP) and increases the proliferation of neoplastic cells. This increases the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to DNSP inhibitors such as methotrexate, L-alanosine and pemetrexed. 7,301 cases of MBC underwent hybrid-capture based comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP). Tumor mutational burden (TMB) was determined on up to 1.1 Mb of sequenced DNA and microsatellite instability (MSI) was determined on 114 loci. Tumor cell PD-L1 expression was determined by IHC (Dako 22C3). 208 (2.84%) of MBC featured <i>MTAP</i> loss. <i>MTAP</i> loss patients were younger (<i>p</i> = 0.002) and were more frequently ER- (30% vs. 50%; <i>p</i> < 0.0001), triple negative (TNBC) (47% vs. 27%; <i>p</i> < 0.0001) and less frequently HER2+ (2% vs. 8%; <i>p</i> = 0.0001) than <i>MTAP</i> intact MBC. Lobular histology and <i>CDH1</i> mutations were more frequent in <i>MTAP</i> intact (14%) than <i>MTAP</i> loss MBC (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). <i>CDKN2A</i> (100%) and <i>CDKN2B</i> (97%) loss (9p21 co-deletion) were significantly associated with <i>MTAP</i> loss (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). Likely associated with the increased TNBC cases, BRCA1 mutation was also more frequent in <i>MTAP</i> loss MBC (10% vs. 4%; <i>p</i> < 0.0001). As for immune checkpoint inhibitors biomarkers, higher TMB >20 mut/Mb levels in the <i>MTAP</i> intact MBC (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) and higher PD-L1 low expression (1-49% TPS) in the <i>MTAP</i> loss <i>MTAP</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.002) were observed. <i>MTAP</i> loss in MBC has distinct clinical features with genomic alterations (GA) affecting both targeted and immunotherapies. Further efforts are necessary to identify alternative means of targeting PRMT5 and MTA2 in <i>MTAP</i>-ve cancers to benefit from the high-MTA environment of <i>MTAP</i>-deficient cancers.",
                "4": "Advanced urothelial carcinoma continues to have a dismal prognosis despite several new therapies in the last 5 years. <i>FGFR2</i> and <i>FGFR3</i> mutations and fusions, PD-L1 expression, tumor mutational burden, and microsatellite instability are established predictive biomarkers in advanced urothelial carcinoma. Novel biomarkers can optimize the sequencing of available treatments and improve outcomes. We describe herein the clinical and pathologic features of patients with an emerging subtype of bladder cancer characterized by deletion of the gene <i>MTAP</i> encoding the enzyme S-Methyl-5'-thioadenosine phosphatase, a potential biomarker of response to pemetrexed. We performed a retrospective analysis of 61 patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma for whom demographics, pathologic specimens, next generation sequencing, and clinical outcomes were available. We compared the frequency of histology variants, upper tract location, pathogenic gene variants, tumor response, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) between patients with tumors harboring <i>MTAP</i> deletion (<i>MTAP</i>-del) and wild type tumors (<i>MTAP</i>-WT). A propensity score matching of 5 covariates (age, gender, presence of variant histology, prior surgery, and prior non-muscle invasive bladder cancer) was calculated to compensate for disparity when comparing survival in these subgroups. Non-supervised clustering analysis of differentially expressed genes between <i>MTAP</i>-del and <i>MTAP</i>-WT urothelial carcinomas was performed. <i>MTAP</i>-del occurred in 19 patients (31%). Tumors with <i>MTAP</i>-del were characterized by higher prevalence of squamous differentiation (47.4 vs 11.9%), bone metastases (52.6 vs 23.5%) and lower frequency of upper urinary tract location (5.2% vs 26.1%). Pathway gene set enrichment analysis showed that among the genes upregulated in the <i>MTAP</i>-del cohort, at least 5 were linked to keratinization (FOXN1, KRT33A/B, KRT84, RPTN) possibly contributing to the higher prevalence of squamous differentiation. Alterations in the PIK3 and MAPK pathways were more frequent when <i>MTAP</i> was deleted. There was a trend to inferior response to chemotherapy among <i>MTAP</i>-del tumors, but no difference in the response to immune checkpoint inhibitors or enfortumab. Median progression free survival after first line therapy (PFS1) was 5.5 months for patients with <i>MTAP</i>-WT and 4.5 months for patients with <i>MTAP</i>-del (HR = 1.30; 95% CI, 0.64-2.63; P = 0.471). There was no difference in the time from metastatic diagnosis to death (P = 0.6346). Median OS from diagnosis of localized or de novo metastatic disease was 16 months (range 1.5-60, IQR 8-26) for patients with MTAP-del and 24.5 months (range 3-156, IQR 16-48) for patients with MTAP-WT (P = 0.0218), suggesting that time to progression to metastatic disease is shorter in MTAP-del patients. Covariates did not impact significantly overall survival on propensity score matching. In conclusion, MTAP -del occurs in approximately 30% of patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma and defines a subgroup of patients with aggressive features, such as squamous differentiation, frequent bone metastases, poor response to chemotherapy, and shorter time to progression to metastatic disease.",
                "5": "When urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) presents or progresses to chemo-refractory metastatic disease, the search for new therapeutic targets is paramount. Targeting protein arginine methyltransferase 5 accumulation in tumors with methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) genomic loss has been proposed as a new anti-tumor strategy. We evaluated the incidence of patients with MTAP loss and correlate to treatment-guiding targets and biomarkers. Two thousand six hundred eighty-three cases of advanced UCB underwent hybrid-capture based comprehensive genomic profiling using the FDA-approved F1CDx assay to evaluate all classes of genomic alterations (GA) among 324 genes. Tumor mutational burden was determined on at least 0.8 Mbp of sequenced DNA and microsatellite instability was determined on at least 95 loci. 650 (24%) of UCB featured MTAP loss mutations (MTAP-). The gene and age distributions were similar in MTAP intact (MTAP+) and MTAP- UCB. MTAP- UCB contained higher GA/tumor frequency than MTAP+ UCB likely reflecting the frequent co-deletions of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A/B. Of potential therapeutic targets, fibroblast growth factor receptor 3, and phosphatase and tensin homolog GA were more frequent in MTAP- UCB. In contrast, biomarkers of immunotherapy response, including higher frequencies of high tumor mutational burden and high programmed death-ligand 1 IHC staining, were observed in the MTAP+ UCB. When compared with MTAP+ UCB, MTAP- UCB differs in genomic signatures including an increase in potentially targetable alterations but a lower frequency of immunotherapy drug biomarkers. Thus, the genomic landscape in MTAP- UCB may play a role in the design of clinical trials incorporating combination treatment strategies when targeting protein arginine methyltransferase 5 in MTAP- tumors.",
                "6": "5'-Methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) is a key enzyme in the methionine salvage pathway and has been reported to suppress tumorigenesis. The MTAP gene is located at 9p21, a chromosome region often deleted in breast cancer (BC). However, the clinical and biological significance of MTAP in BC is still unclear. Here, we reported that MTAP was frequently downregulated in 41% (35/85) of primary BCs and 89% (8/9) of BC cell lines. Low expression of MTAP was significantly correlated with a poor survival of BC patients (P=0.0334). Functional studies showed that MTAP was able to suppress both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> tumorigenic ability of BC cells, including migration, invasion, angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastasis in nude mice with orthotopic xenograft tumor of BC. Mechanistically, we found that downregulation of MTAP could increase the polyamine levels by activating ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). By treating the MTAP-repressing BC cells with specific ODC inhibitor Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) or treating the MTAP-overexpressing BC cells with additional putrescine, metastasis-promoting or -suppressing phenotype of these MTAP-manipulated cells was significantly reversed, respectively. Taken together, our data suggested that MTAP has a critical metastasis-suppressive role by tightly regulating ODC activity in BC cells, which may serve as a prominent novel therapeutic target for advanced breast cancer treatment.",
                "7": "Diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) bearing driver mutations of histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27M) are incurable brain tumors with unique epigenomes. Here, we generated a syngeneic H3K27M mouse model to study the amino acid metabolic dependencies of these tumors. H3K27M mutant cells were highly dependent on methionine. Interrogating the methionine cycle dependency through a short-interfering RNA screen identified the enzyme methionine adenosyltransferase 2A (MAT2A) as a critical vulnerability in these tumors. This vulnerability was not mediated through the canonical mechanism of MTAP deletion; instead, DMG cells have lower levels of MAT2A protein, which is mediated by negative feedback induced by the metabolite decarboxylated S-adenosyl methionine. Depletion of residual MAT2A induces global depletion of H3K36me3, a chromatin mark of transcriptional elongation perturbing oncogenic and developmental transcriptional programs. Moreover, methionine-restricted diets extended survival in multiple models of DMG in vivo. Collectively, our results suggest that MAT2A presents an exploitable therapeutic vulnerability in H3K27M gliomas.",
                "8": "Genetic alterations in FGF/FGFR pathway are infrequent in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), with rare cases of quadruple wildtype GISTs harboring FGFR1 gene fusions and mutations. Additionally, FGF/FGFR overexpression was shown to promote drug resistance to kinase inhibitors in GISTs. However, FGFR gene fusions have not been directly implicated as a mechanism of drug resistance in GISTs. Herein, we report a patient presenting with a primary small bowel spindle cell GIST and concurrent peritoneal and liver metastases displaying an imatinib-sensitive KIT exon 11 in-frame deletion. After an initial 9-month benefit to imatinib, the patient experienced intraabdominal peritoneal recurrence owing to secondary KIT exon 13 missense mutation and FGFR4 amplification. Despite several additional rounds of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), the patient's disease progressed after 2\u2009years and presented with multiple peritoneal and liver metastases, including one pericolonic mass harboring secondary KIT exon 18 missense mutation, and a concurrent transverse colonic mass with a FGFR2::TACC2 fusion and AKT2 amplification. All tumors, including primary and recurrent masses, harbored an MGA c.7272\u2009T\u2009>\u2009G (p.Y2424*) nonsense mutation and CDKN2A/CDKN2B/MTAP deletions. The transcolonic mass showed elevated mitotic count (18/10 HPF), as well as significant decrease in CD117 and DOG1 expression, in contrast to all the other resistant nodules that displayed diffuse and strong CD117 and DOG1 immunostaining. The FGFR2::TACC2 fusion resulted from a 742\u2009kb intrachromosomal inversion at the chr10q26.3 locus, leading to a fusion between exons 1-17 of FGFR2 and exons 7-17 TACC2, which preserves the extracellular and protein tyrosine kinase domains of FGFR2. We present the first report of a multidrug-resistant GIST patient who developed an FGFR2 gene fusion as a secondary genetic event to the selective pressure of various TKIs. This case also highlights the heterogeneous escape mechanisms to targeted therapy across various tumor nodules, spanning from both KIT-dependent and KIT-independent off-target activation pathways.",
                "9": "The overall survival of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains poor and its incidence is rising. Targetable mutations in PDAC are rare, thus novel therapeutic approaches are needed. Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) overexpression is associated with worse survival and inhibition of PRMT5 results in decreased cancer growth across multiple cancers, including PDAC. Emerging evidence also suggests that altered RNA processing is a driver in PDAC tumorigenesis and creates a partial dependency on this process. PRMT5 inhibition induces altered splicing and this vulnerability can be exploited as a novel therapeutic approach. Three possible biological pathways underpinning the action of PRMT5 inhibitors are discussed; c-Myc regulation appears central to its action in the PDAC setting. Whilst homozygous MTAP deletion and symmetrical dimethylation levels are associated with increased sensitivity to PRMT5 inhibition, neither measure robustly predicts its growth inhibitory response. The immunomodulatory effect of PRMT5 inhibitors on the tumour microenvironment will also be discussed, based on emerging evidence that PDAC stroma has a significant bearing on disease behaviour and response to therapy. Lastly, with the above caveats in mind, current knowledge gaps and the implications and rationales for PRMT5 inhibitor development in PDAC will be explored."

                "0": "Familial platelet disorder with associated myeloid malignancies (FPDMM) is caused by germline RUNX1 mutations and characterized by thrombocytopenia and increased risk of hematologic malignancies. We recently launched a longitudinal natural history study for patients with FPDMM. Among 27 families with research genomic data by the end of 2021, 26 different germline RUNX1 variants were detected. Besides missense mutations enriched in Runt homology domain and loss-of-function mutations distributed throughout the gene, splice-region mutations and large deletions were detected in 6 and 7 families, respectively. In 25 of 51 (49%) patients without hematologic malignancy, somatic mutations were detected in at least 1 of the clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) genes or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) driver genes. BCOR was the most frequently mutated gene (in 9 patients), and multiple BCOR mutations were identified in 4 patients. Mutations in 6 other CHIP- or AML-driver genes (TET2, DNMT3A, KRAS, LRP1B, IDH1, and KMT2C) were also found in \u22652 patients without hematologic malignancy. Moreover, 3 unrelated patients (1 with myeloid malignancy) carried somatic mutations in NFE2, which regulates erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation. Sequential sequencing data from 19 patients demonstrated dynamic changes of somatic mutations over time, and stable clones were more frequently found in older adult patients. In summary, there are diverse types of germline RUNX1 mutations and high frequency of somatic mutations related to clonal hematopoiesis in patients with FPDMM. Monitoring changes in somatic mutations and clinical manifestations prospectively may reveal mechanisms for malignant progression and inform clinical management. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT03854318.",
                "1": "Adenocarcinomas of the nasal/paranasal sinuses are uncommon, but intestinal-type adenocarcinomas (ITACs) are important. Due to the rarity of these tumors, their molecular profile is not well known. To further investigate the molecular profile and find potential oncogenic drivers, we compared the whole transcriptome and exome of ITACs at different anatomic locations in the head and neck. Twenty-one head and neck adenocarcinomas were used in this study, divided into 10 sinonasal adenocarcinomas (SNT) and 11 extrasinonasal (T) head and neck adenocarcinomas according to anatomic location and histology. Tumor samples along with normal mucosa were microdissected from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples, and RNA and DNA were subjected to whole-transcriptome and -exome shotgun sequencing. Analysis of ITACs at sinonasal locations showed 410 subtype-specific differentially expressed (DE) genes and noncoding transcripts compared with the group of other anatomic locations, with 2909 subtype-specific DE genes. The groups shared 872 genes, with 17 highly different or opposing DE genes. Whole-exome mutation analysis revealed the gene MLL3 (KMT2C) to be exhibiting the most frequent loss-of-function mutations in all adenocarcinomas investigated. The results suggest that the head and neck ITACs investigated were mainly caused by loss-of-function mutations in MLL3 that disabled chromatin methylation and remodeling of all MLL3-targeted enhancers in the tumors. This changed the activity of multiple genes/gene clusters, supporting oncogenicity mostly via pathways of signaling, dedifferentiation, proliferation, migration, and immune and inflammatory deregulation, indicating a truly epigenetic event as the root cause for the heterogenous diversity of these enteric types of cancer. The data of this study form the basis for understanding cell fate determination and cellular homeostasis in the normal respiratory mucosa at different anatomic sites and show the contribution of different mucosal components to the etiology/molecular pathology of ITAC.",

                "3": "(1) Background: Germline variants in <i>BRCA1/BRCA2</i> genes explain about 20% of hereditary breast/ovarian cancer (HBOC) cases. In the present paper, we aim to identify genetic determinants in <i>BRCA</i>-negative families from the South of Tunisia. (2) Methods: Exome Sequencing (ES) was performed on the lymphocyte DNA of patients negative for <i>BRCA</i> mutations from each Tunisian family with a high risk of HBOC. (3) Results: We focus on the canonical genes associated with HBOC and identified missense variants in DNA damage response genes, such as <i>ATM</i>, <i>RAD52</i>, and <i>RAD54</i>; however, no variants in <i>PALB2</i>, <i>Chek2</i>, and <i>TP53</i> genes were found. To identify novel candidate genes, we selected variants harboring a loss of function and identified 17 stop-gain and 11 frameshift variants in genes not commonly known to be predisposed to HBOC. Then, we focus on rare and high-impact genes shared by at least 3 unrelated patients from each family and selected 16 gene variants. Through combined data analysis from MCODE with gene ontology and KEGG pathways, a short list of eight candidate genes (<i>ATM</i>, <i>EP300</i>, <i>LAMA1</i>, <i>LAMC2</i>, <i>TNNI3</i>, <i>MYLK</i>, <i>COL11A2</i>, and <i>LAMB3</i>) was created. The impact of the 24 selected genes on survival was analyzed using the TCGA data resulting in a selection of five candidate genes (<i>EP300</i>, <i>KMT2C</i>, <i>RHPN2</i>, <i>HSPG2</i>, and <i>CCR3)</i> that showed a significant association with survival. (4) Conclusions: We identify novel candidate genes predisposed to HBOC that need to be validated in larger cohorts and investigated by analyzing the co-segregation of selected variants in affected families and the locus-specific loss of heterozygosity to highlight their relevance for HBOC risk.",
                "4": "Prognostic markers for cancer can assist in the evaluation of survival probability of patients and help clinicians to assess the available treatment modalities. Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is a rare tumor that causes 165\u2009087 deaths in the world annually. It is the most common cancer of the biliary tract and has a particularly high incidence in Chile, Japan, and northern India. Currently, there is no accurate diagnosis test or effective molecular markers for GBC identification. Several studies have focused on the discovery of genetic alterations in important genes associated with GBC to propose novel diagnosis pathways and to create prognostic profiles. To achieve this, we performed data-mining of GBC in public repositories, harboring 133 samples of GBC, allowing us to describe relevant somatic mutations in important genes and to propose a genetic alteration atlas for GBC. In our results, we reported the 14 most altered genes in GBC: <i>arid1a, arid2, atm, ctnnb1, erbb2, erbb3, kmt2c, kmt2d, kras, pik3ca, smad4, tert, tp53</i>, and <i>znf521</i> in samples from Japan, the United States, Chile, and China. Missense mutations are common among these genes. The annotations of many mutations revealed their importance in cancer development. The observed annotations mentioned that several mutations found in this repository are probably oncogenic, with a putative loss-of-function. In addition, they are hotspot mutations and are probably linked to poor prognosis in other cancers. We identified another 11 genes, which presented a copy number alteration in gallbladder database samples, which are <i>ccnd1, ccnd3, ccne1, cdk12, cdkn2a, cdkn2b, erbb2, erbb3, kras, mdm2</i>, and <i>myc</i>. The findings reported here can help to detect GBC cancer through the development of systems based on genetic alterations, for example, the development of a mutation panel specifically for GBC diagnosis, as well as the creation of prognostic profiles to accomplish the development of GBC and its prevalence.",
                "5": "The oncogenic events involved in breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BI-ALCL) remain elusive. To clarify this point, we have characterized the genomic landscape of 34 BI-ALCLs (15 tumor and 19 in situ subtypes) collected from 54 BI-ALCL patients diagnosed through the French Lymphopath network. Whole-exome sequencing (n = 22, with paired tumor/germline DNA) and/or targeted deep sequencing (n = 24) showed recurrent mutations of epigenetic modifiers in 74% of cases, involving notably KMT2C (26%), KMT2D (9%), CHD2 (15%), and CREBBP (15%). KMT2D and KMT2C mutations correlated with a loss of H3K4 mono- and trimethylation by immunohistochemistry. Twenty cases (59%) showed mutations in \u22651 member of the JAK/STAT pathway, including STAT3 (38%), JAK1 (18%), and STAT5B (3%), and in negative regulators, including SOCS3 (6%), SOCS1 (3%), and PTPN1 (3%). These mutations were more frequent in tumor-type samples than in situ samples (P = .038). All BI-ALCLs expressed pSTAT3, regardless of the mutational status of genes in the JAK/STAT pathway. Mutations in the EOMES gene (12%) involved in lymphocyte development, PI3K-AKT/mTOR (6%), and loss-of-function mutations in TP53 (12%) were also identified. Copy-number aberration (CNA) analysis identified recurrent alterations, including gains on chromosomes 2, 9p, 12p, and 21 and losses on 4q, 8p, 15, 16, and 20. Regions of CNA encompassed genes involved in the JAK/STAT pathway and epigenetic regulators. Our results show that the BI-ALCL genomic landscape is characterized by not only JAK/STAT activating mutations but also loss-of-function alterations of epigenetic modifiers.",
                "6": "Metastasis is the main cause of death for patients with breast cancer. Many studies have characterized the genomic landscape of breast cancer during its early stages. However, there is evidence that genomic alterations are acquired during the evolution of cancers from their early to late stages, and that the genomic landscape of early cancers is not representative of that of lethal cancers<sup>1-7</sup>. Here we investigated the landscape of somatic alterations in 617 metastatic breast cancers. Nine driver genes (TP53, ESR1, GATA3, KMT2C, NCOR1, AKT1, NF1, RIC8A and RB1) were more frequently mutated in metastatic breast cancers that expressed hormone receptors (oestrogen and/or progesterone receptors; HR<sup>+</sup>) but did not have high levels of HER2 (HER2<sup>-</sup>; n\u00a0=\u00a0381), when compared to early breast cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas. In addition, 18 amplicons were more frequently observed in HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>-</sup> metastatic breast cancers. These cancers showed an increase in mutational signatures S2, S3, S10, S13 and S17. Among the gene alterations that were enriched in HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>-</sup> metastatic breast cancers, mutations in TP53, RB1 and NF1, together with S10, S13 and S17, were associated with poor outcome. Metastatic triple-negative breast cancers showed an increase in the frequency of somatic biallelic loss-of-function mutations in genes related to homologous recombination DNA repair, compared to early triple-negative breast cancers (7% versus 2%). Finally, metastatic breast cancers showed an increase in mutational burden and clonal diversity compared to early breast cancers. Thus, the genomic landscape of metastatic breast cancer is enriched in clinically relevant genomic alterations and is more complex than that of early breast cancer. The identification of genomic alterations associated with poor outcome will allow earlier and better selection of patients who require the use of treatments that are still in clinical trials. The genetic complexity observed in advanced breast cancer suggests that such treatments should be introduced as early as possible in the disease course.",
                "7": "The landscape of cancer-predisposing genes has been extensively investigated in the last 30\u00a0years with various methodologies ranging from candidate gene to genome-wide association studies. However, sequencing data are still poorly exploited in cancer predisposition studies due to the lack of statistical power when comparing millions of variants at once. To overcome these power limitations, we propose a knowledge-based framework founded on the characteristics of known cancer-predisposing variants and genes. Under our framework, we took advantage of a combination of previously generated datasets of sequencing experiments to identify novel breast cancer-predisposing variants, comparing the normal genomes of 673 breast cancer patients of European origin against 27,173 controls matched by ethnicity. We detected several expected variants on known breast cancer-predisposing genes, like BRCA1 and BRCA2, and 11 variants on genes associated with other cancer types, like RET and AKT1. Furthermore, we detected 183 variants that overlap with somatic mutations in cancer and 41 variants associated with 38 possible loss-of-function genes, including PIK3CB and KMT2C. Finally, we found a set of 19 variants that are potentially pathogenic, negatively correlate with age at onset, and have never been associated with breast cancer. In this study, we demonstrate the usefulness of a genomic-driven approach nested in a classic case-control study to prioritize cancer-predisposing variants. In addition, we provide a resource containing variants that may affect susceptibility to breast cancer."

Overexpression of PARP1 was found in BCSC enriched populations (detected by ALDH+) when compared to mature cell populations (ALDH-) in 4 BRCA1 mutant and 1 BRCA1 wild-type cell lines.  Cell lines were treated with 10 \u00b5m olaparib.  The cell line with the highest PARP1 expression (HCC1937) showed a significant increase cell population after treatment (p=0.01).

Initial results found combination therapy significantly reduced colony growth (p<0.001) in high-PARP1-expressing cells while no significant reduction was observed in low-PARP1-expressing cells.  Xenograft model of a high PARP1 uterine leiomyosarcoma found trabectedin + olaparib significantly reduced tumor growth and halted the spread of metastasis (p<0.001 vs. single agents and control).  In comparison, the xenograft model of low PARP1 osteosarcoma found the combination had a non-significant benefit compared to trabectedin alone.  Finally, silencing of PARP1 reduced sensitivity to combination therapy while lentiviral overexpression of PARP1 increased sensitivity to combination therapy."

MTAP deletion is also observed in breast cancer. \n\n- Gene: PARP1 \nPARP1 is overexpressed in breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) enriched populations and is correlated with resistance to olaparib, a PARP1 inhibitor. Moderate to high expression of PARP1 and PARP2 is observed in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST).

Trabectedin is an isoquinoline alkylating agent with a peculiar mechanism of action. It binds to minor groove of DNA inducing single- and double-strand-breaks. These kinds of damage lead to the activation of PARP1, a first-line enzyme in DNA-damage response pathways. We hypothesized that PARP1 targeting could perpetuate trabectedin-induced DNA damage in tumor cells leading finally to cell death.We investigated trabectedin and PARP1 inhibitor synergism in several tumor histotypes both in vitro and in vivo (subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor xenografts in mice). We searched for key determinants of drug synergism by comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and gene expression profiling (GEP) and validated their functional role.Trabectedin activated PARP1 enzyme and the combination with PARP1 inhibitors potentiated DNA damage, cell cycle arrest at G2/M checkpoint and apoptosis, if compared to single agents. Olaparib was the most active PARP1 inhibitor to combine with trabectedin and we confirmed the antitumor and antimetastatic activity of trabectedin/olaparib combination in mice models. However, we observed different degree of trabectedin/olaparib synergism among different cell lines. Namely, in DMR leiomyosarcoma models the combination was significantly more active than single agents, while in SJSA-1 osteosarcoma models no further advantage was obtained if compared to trabectedin alone. aCGH and GEP revealed that key components of DNA-repair pathways were involved in trabectedin/olaparib synergism. In particular, PARP1 expression dictated the degree of the synergism. Indeed, trabectedin/olaparib synergism was increased after PARP1 overexpression and reduced after PARP1 silencing.PARP1 inhibition potentiated trabectedin activity in a PARP1-dependent manner and PARP1 expression in tumor cells might be a useful predictive biomarker that deserves clinical evaluation.', 'ascoAbstractId': None, 'authorString': \"Ymera Pignochino, Federica Capozzi, Lorenzo D'Ambrosio, Carmine Dell'Aglio, Marco Basiric\u00f2, Marta Canta, Annalisa Lorenzato, Francesca Vignolo Lutati, Sandra Aliberti, Erica Palesandro, Paola Boccone, Danilo Galizia, Sara Miano, Giulia Chiabotto, Lucia Napione, Loretta Gammaitoni, Dario Sangiolo, Maria Serena Benassi, Barbara Pasini, Giovanna Chiorino, Massimo Aglietta, Giovanni Grignani\", 'citation': 'Pignochino et al., 2017', 'citationId': '28454547', 'clinicalTrials': [], 'comments': {'edges': []}, 'displayType': 'PubMed', 'events': {'edges': []}, 'fullJournalTitle': 'Molecular cancer', 'fullyCurated': False, 'id': 3159, 'journal': 'Mol Cancer', 'lastCommentEvent': None, 'link': '/sources/3159', 'name': 'PubMed: Pignochino et al., 2017', 'openAccess': True, 'pmcId': 'PMC5410089', 'publicationDate': '2017-4-28', 'publicationDay': 28, 'publicationMonth': 4, 'publicationYear': 2017, 'sourceType': 'PUBMED', 'sourceUrl': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28454547', 'title': 'PARP1 expression drives the synergistic antitumor activity of trabectedin and PARP1 inhibitors in sarcoma preclinical models.', 'citation_count': 31, 'MeSH_terms': ['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'DNA Damage', 'Dioxoles', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Phthalazines', 'Piperazines', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1', 'Sarcoma', 'Tetrahydroisoquinolines', 'Trabectedin', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']}, 'status': 'SUBMITTED', 'therapies': [{'id': 6356}, {'id': 42}], 'therapyInteractionType': 'COMBINATION', 'variantOrigin': 'NA'}}}}}, '3659': {'gene_name': 'MTAP', 'geneAliases': ['BDMF', 'DMSFH', 'DMSMFH', 'HEL-249', 'LGMBF', 'MSAP', 'MTAP', 'c86fus'], 'gene_official_name': 'methylthioadenosine phosphorylase', 'gene_description': '', 'gene_summary': 'This gene encodes an enzyme that plays a major role in polyamine metabolism and is important for the salvage of both adenine and methionine.

Whereas KMT2C loss disrupts estrogen-driven proliferation, it conversely promotes tumor outgrowth under hormone-depleted conditions. In accordance, KMT2C is one of the most frequently mutated genes in ER-positive breast cancer with KMT2C deletion correlating with significantly shorter progression-free survival on anti-estrogen therapy. From a therapeutic standpoint, KMT2C-depleted cells that develop hormone-independence retain their dependence on ER\u03b1, displaying ongoing sensitivity to ER\u03b1 antagonists.

While no specific mutations in BRCA1/2 have been reported in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), MPNST cells could be effectively targeted with a PARP inhibitor to drive cells to synthetic lethality due to their complex karyotype and high level of inherent genomic instability. In this study, we assessed the expression levels of PARP1 and PARP2 in MPNST patient tumor samples and correlated these findings with overall survival. We also determined the level of PARP activity in MPNST cell lines. In addition, we evaluated the efficacy of the PARP inhibitor AZD2281 (Olaparib) in MPNST cell lines. We observed decreased MPNST cell proliferation and enhanced apoptosis in vitro at doses similar to, or less than, the doses used in cell lines with established defective DNA repair genes. Furthermore, AZD2281 significantly reduced local growth of MPNST xenografts, decreased the development of macroscopic lung metastases, and increased survival of mice with metastatic disease. Our results suggest that AZD2281 could be an effective therapeutic option in MPNST and should be further investigated for its potential clinical use in this malignancy.",

Total proteins were extracted from both fractions and subjected to 2-Dimensional Difference In-Gel Electrophoresis (2-D DIGE). Differentially-expressed spots were excised and proteins were gel-extracted, digested and identified using MALDI-TOF MS.2-D DIGE identified poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) as overexpressed in ALDH+ cells from BrCA-MZ-01. This observation was confirmed by western blot and extended to four additional human BCLs. ALDH+ cells from BRCA1-mutated HCC1937, which had the highest level of PARP1 overexpression, displayed resistance to olaparib, a specific PARP1 inhibitor.An unbiased proteomic approach identified PARP1 as upregulated in ALDH+, BCSC-enriched cells from various human BCLs, which may contribute to clinical resistance to PARP inhibitors.",

Trabectedin is an isoquinoline alkylating agent with a peculiar mechanism of action. It binds to minor groove of DNA inducing single- and double-strand-breaks. These kinds of damage lead to the activation of PARP1, a first-line enzyme in DNA-damage response pathways. We hypothesized that PARP1 targeting could perpetuate trabectedin-induced DNA damage in tumor cells leading finally to cell death.We investigated trabectedin and PARP1 inhibitor synergism in several tumor histotypes both in vitro and in vivo (subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor xenografts in mice). We searched for key determinants of drug synergism by comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and gene expression profiling (GEP) and validated their functional role.Trabectedin activated PARP1 enzyme and the combination with PARP1 inhibitors potentiated DNA damage, cell cycle arrest at G2/M checkpoint and apoptosis, if compared to single agents. Olaparib was the most active PARP1 inhibitor to combine with trabectedin and we confirmed the antitumor and antimetastatic activity of trabectedin/olaparib combination in mice models. However, we observed different degree of trabectedin/olaparib synergism among different cell lines. Namely, in DMR leiomyosarcoma models the combination was significantly more active than single agents, while in SJSA-1 osteosarcoma models no further advantage was obtained if compared to trabectedin alone. aCGH and GEP revealed that key components of DNA-repair pathways were involved in trabectedin/olaparib synergism. In particular, PARP1 expression dictated the degree of the synergism. Indeed, trabectedin/olaparib synergism was increased after PARP1 overexpression and reduced after PARP1 silencing.PARP1 inhibition potentiated trabectedin activity in a PARP1-dependent manner and PARP1 expression in tumor cells might be a useful predictive biomarker that deserves clinical evaluation.",

The gene is located at 9p21, a chromosome region often deleted in breast carcinomas, similar to CDKN2A, a recognized tumor suppressor gene. Several research groups have shown that MTAP acts as a tumor suppressor, and some therapeutic approaches were proposed based on a tumors\u00b4 MTAP status. We analyzed MTAP and CDKN2A gene (RT-qPCR) and protein (western-blotting) expression in seven breast cancer cell lines and evaluated their promoter methylation patterns to better characterize the contribution of these genes to breast cancer. Cytotoxicity assays with inhibitors of de novo adenine synthesis (5-FU, AZA and MTX) after MTAP gene knockdown showed an increased sensitivity, mainly to 5-FU. MTAP expression was also evaluated in two groups of samples from breast cancer patients, fresh tumors and paired normal breast tissue, and from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) core breast cancer samples diagnosed as Luminal-A tumors and triple negative breast tumors (TNBC). The difference of MTAP expression between fresh tumors and normal tissues was not statistically significant. However, MTAP expression was significantly higher in Luminal-A breast tumors than in TNBC, suggesting the lack of expression in more aggressive breast tumors and the possibility of using the new approaches based on MTAP status in TNBC.",

These master-regulatory functions of ER\u03b1 require trans-acting elements such as the pioneer factor FOXA1 to establish a genomic landscape conducive to ER\u03b1 control. Here, we identify the H3K4 methyltransferase KMT2C as necessary for hormone-driven ER\u03b1 activity and breast cancer proliferation. KMT2C knockdown suppresses estrogen-dependent gene expression and causes H3K4me1 and H3K27ac loss selectively at ER\u03b1 enhancers. Correspondingly, KMT2C loss impairs estrogen-driven breast cancer proliferation but has no effect on ER- breast cells. Whereas KMT2C loss disrupts estrogen-driven proliferation, it conversely promotes tumor outgrowth under hormone-depleted conditions. In accordance, KMT2C is one of the most frequently mutated genes in ER-positive breast cancer with KMT2C deletion correlating with significantly shorter progression-free survival on anti-estrogen therapy. From a therapeutic standpoint, KMT2C-depleted cells that develop hormone-independence retain their dependence on ER\u03b1, displaying ongoing sensitivity to ER\u03b1 antagonists. We conclude that KMT2C is a key regulator of ER\u03b1 activity whose loss uncouples breast cancer proliferation from hormone abundance.",

Trabectedin is an isoquinoline alkylating agent with a peculiar mechanism of action. It binds to minor groove of DNA inducing single- and double-strand-breaks. These kinds of damage lead to the activation of PARP1, a first-line enzyme in DNA-damage response pathways. We hypothesized that PARP1 targeting could perpetuate trabectedin-induced DNA damage in tumor cells leading finally to cell death.We investigated trabectedin and PARP1 inhibitor synergism in several tumor histotypes both in vitro and in vivo (subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor xenografts in mice). We searched for key determinants of drug synergism by comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and gene expression profiling (GEP) and validated their functional role.Trabectedin activated PARP1 enzyme and the combination with PARP1 inhibitors potentiated DNA damage, cell cycle arrest at G2/M checkpoint and apoptosis, if compared to single agents. Olaparib was the most active PARP1 inhibitor to combine with trabectedin and we confirmed the antitumor and antimetastatic activity of trabectedin/olaparib combination in mice models. However, we observed different degree of trabectedin/olaparib synergism among different cell lines. Namely, in DMR leiomyosarcoma models the combination was significantly more active than single agents, while in SJSA-1 osteosarcoma models no further advantage was obtained if compared to trabectedin alone. aCGH and GEP revealed that key components of DNA-repair pathways were involved in trabectedin/olaparib synergism. In particular, PARP1 expression dictated the degree of the synergism. Indeed, trabectedin/olaparib synergism was increased after PARP1 overexpression and reduced after PARP1 silencing.PARP1 inhibition potentiated trabectedin activity in a PARP1-dependent manner and PARP1 expression in tumor cells might be a useful predictive biomarker that deserves clinical evaluation.', 'ascoAbstractId': None, 'authorString': \"Ymera Pignochino, Federica Capozzi, Lorenzo D'Ambrosio, Carmine Dell'Aglio, Marco Basiric\u00f2, Marta Canta, Annalisa Lorenzato, Francesca Vignolo Lutati, Sandra Aliberti, Erica Palesandro, Paola Boccone, Danilo Galizia, Sara Miano, Giulia Chiabotto, Lucia Napione, Loretta Gammaitoni, Dario Sangiolo, Maria Serena Benassi, Barbara Pasini, Giovanna Chiorino, Massimo Aglietta, Giovanni Grignani\", 'citation': 'Pignochino et al., 2017', 'citationId': '28454547', 'clinicalTrials': [], 'comments': {'edges': []}, 'displayType': 'PubMed', 'events': {'edges': []}, 'fullJournalTitle': 'Molecular cancer', 'fullyCurated': False, 'id': 3159, 'journal': 'Mol Cancer', 'lastCommentEvent': None, 'link': '/sources/3159', 'name': 'PubMed: Pignochino et al., 2017', 'openAccess': True, 'pmcId': 'PMC5410089', 'publicationDate': '2017-4-28', 'publicationDay': 28, 'publicationMonth': 4, 'publicationYear': 2017, 'sourceType': 'PUBMED', 'sourceUrl': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28454547', 'title': 'PARP1 expression drives the synergistic antitumor activity of trabectedin and PARP1 inhibitors in sarcoma preclinical models.', 'citation_count': 31, 'MeSH_terms': ['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'DNA Damage', 'Dioxoles', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Phthalazines', 'Piperazines', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1', 'Sarcoma', 'Tetrahydroisoquinolines', 'Trabectedin', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']}, 'status': 'SUBMITTED', 'therapies': [{'id': 6356}, {'id': 42}], 'therapyInteractionType': 'COMBINATION', 'variantOrigin': 'NA'}}}}}, '3659': {'gene_name': 'MTAP', 'geneAliases': ['BDMF', 'DMSFH', 'DMSMFH', 'HEL-249', 'LGMBF', 'MSAP', 'MTAP', 'c86fus'], 'gene_official_name': 'methylthioadenosine phosphorylase', 'gene_description': '', 'gene_summary': 'This gene encodes an enzyme that plays a major role in polyamine metabolism and is important for the salvage of both adenine and methionine.

These master-regulatory functions of ER\u03b1 require trans-acting elements such as the pioneer factor FOXA1 to establish a genomic landscape conducive to ER\u03b1 control. Here, we identify the H3K4 methyltransferase KMT2C as necessary for hormone-driven ER\u03b1 activity and breast cancer proliferation. KMT2C knockdown suppresses estrogen-dependent gene expression and causes H3K4me1 and H3K27ac loss selectively at ER\u03b1 enhancers. Correspondingly, KMT2C loss impairs estrogen-driven breast cancer proliferation but has no effect on ER- breast cells. Whereas KMT2C loss disrupts estrogen-driven proliferation, it conversely promotes tumor outgrowth under hormone-depleted conditions. In accordance, KMT2C is one of the most frequently mutated genes in ER-positive breast cancer with KMT2C deletion correlating with significantly shorter progression-free survival on anti-estrogen therapy. From a therapeutic standpoint, KMT2C-depleted cells that develop hormone-independence retain their dependence on ER\u03b1, displaying ongoing sensitivity to ER\u03b1 antagonists.

Trabectedin is an isoquinoline alkylating agent with a peculiar mechanism of action. It binds to minor groove of DNA inducing single- and double-strand-breaks. These kinds of damage lead to the activation of PARP1, a first-line enzyme in DNA-damage response pathways. We hypothesized that PARP1 targeting could perpetuate trabectedin-induced DNA damage in tumor cells leading finally to cell death.We investigated trabectedin and PARP1 inhibitor synergism in several tumor histotypes both in vitro and in vivo (subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor xenografts in mice). We searched for key determinants of drug synergism by comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and gene expression profiling (GEP) and validated their functional role.Trabectedin activated PARP1 enzyme and the combination with PARP1 inhibitors potentiated DNA damage, cell cycle arrest at G2/M checkpoint and apoptosis, if compared to single agents. Olaparib was the most active PARP1 inhibitor to combine with trabectedin and we confirmed the antitumor and antimetastatic activity of trabectedin/olaparib combination in mice models. However, we observed different degree of trabectedin/olaparib synergism among different cell lines. Namely, in DMR leiomyosarcoma models the combination was significantly more active than single agents, while in SJSA-1 osteosarcoma models no further advantage was obtained if compared to trabectedin alone. aCGH and GEP revealed that key components of DNA-repair pathways were involved in trabectedin/olaparib synergism. In particular, PARP1 expression dictated the degree of the synergism. Indeed, trabectedin/olaparib synergism was increased after PARP1 overexpression and reduced after PARP1 silencing.PARP1 inhibition potentiated trabectedin activity in a PARP1-dependent manner and PARP1 expression in tumor cells might be a useful predictive biomarker that deserves clinical evaluation.', 'ascoAbstractId': None, 'authorString': \"Ymera Pignochino, Federica Capozzi, Lorenzo D'Ambrosio, Carmine Dell'Aglio, Marco Basiric\u00f2, Marta Canta, Annalisa Lorenzato, Francesca Vignolo Lutati, Sandra Aliberti, Erica Palesandro, Paola Boccone, Danilo Galizia, Sara Miano, Giulia Chiabotto, Lucia Napione, Loretta Gammaitoni, Dario Sangiolo, Maria Serena Benassi, Barbara Pasini, Giovanna Chiorino, Massimo Aglietta, Giovanni Grignani\", 'citation': 'Pignochino et al., 2017', 'citationId': '28454547', 'clinicalTrials': [], 'comments': {'edges': []}, 'displayType': 'PubMed', 'events': {'edges': []}, 'fullJournalTitle': 'Molecular cancer', 'fullyCurated': False, 'id': 3159, 'journal': 'Mol Cancer', 'lastCommentEvent': None, 'link': '/sources/3159', 'name': 'PubMed: Pignochino et al., 2017', 'openAccess': True, 'pmcId': 'PMC5410089', 'publicationDate': '2017-4-28', 'publicationDay': 28, 'publicationMonth': 4, 'publicationYear': 2017, 'sourceType': 'PUBMED', 'sourceUrl': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28454547', 'title': 'PARP1 expression drives the synergistic antitumor activity of trabectedin and PARP1 inhibitors in sarcoma preclinical models.', 'citation_count': 31, 'MeSH_terms': ['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'DNA Damage', 'Dioxoles', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Phthalazines', 'Piperazines', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1', 'Sarcoma', 'Tetrahydroisoquinolines', 'Trabectedin', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']}, 'status': 'SUBMITTED', 'therapies': [{'id': 6356}, {'id': 42}], 'therapyInteractionType': 'COMBINATION', 'variantOrigin': 'NA'}}}}}, '3659': {'gene_name': 'MTAP', 'geneAliases': ['BDMF', 'DMSFH', 'DMSMFH', 'HEL-249', 'LGMBF', 'MSAP', 'MTAP', 'c86fus'], 'gene_official_name': 'methylthioadenosine phosphorylase', 'gene_description': '', 'gene_summary': 'This gene encodes an enzyme that plays a major role in polyamine metabolism and is important for the salvage of both adenine and methionine.

Here, we identify the H3K4 methyltransferase KMT2C as necessary for hormone-driven ER\u03b1 activity and breast cancer proliferation. KMT2C knockdown suppresses estrogen-dependent gene expression and causes H3K4me1 and H3K27ac loss selectively at ER\u03b1 enhancers. Correspondingly, KMT2C loss impairs estrogen-driven breast cancer proliferation but has no effect on ER- breast cells. Whereas KMT2C loss disrupts estrogen-driven proliferation, it conversely promotes tumor outgrowth under hormone-depleted conditions. In accordance, KMT2C is one of the most frequently mutated genes in ER-positive breast cancer with KMT2C deletion correlating with significantly shorter progression-free survival on anti-estrogen therapy. From a therapeutic standpoint, KMT2C-depleted cells that develop hormone-independence retain their dependence on ER\u03b1, displaying ongoing sensitivity to ER\u03b1 antagonists.

It has been linked to prognosis and tamoxifen resistance. However, results have been ambiguous. The different functions of AIB1 in ER\u03b1-positive and -negative disease are poorly understood. Therefore, we analyzed the clinical significance of AIB1 in breast cancer with respect to ER\u03b1-status and characterized the subgroups. 2,197 breast carcinomas sampled on a pre-existing tissue microarray (TMA) were analyzed for AIB1 expression and amplification by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).AIB1 expression was detected in 60\u00a0% of the tumors. It was associated with tumor size (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003), high histological grade (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), poor disease-specific, and overall survival (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0018 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.003). There was a strong inverse relationship between AIB1 and ER\u03b1 expression (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). AIB1 overexpression was associated with increased Ki67 labeling index (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), even if analyzed for different ER expression levels. AIB1 amplification was found in 11\u00a0% of the carcinomas. It was associated with high histological grade (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0012), lymph node involvement (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0163), and poor disease-specific survival (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0032) but not with overall survival (p\u00a0=\u00a00.1672) or ER status (p\u00a0=\u00a00.4456). If ER-positive tumors were stratified according to their AIB1 amplification status, there was a significant worse disease-specific survival in cases showing AIB1 amplification (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0017). AIB1 expression is associated with unfavorable prognosis and tumor phenotype. It seems to unfold its oncogenic potential at least in part independent from its role as an ER\u03b1 co-activator. AIB1 has an impact on cell cycle regulation in ER\u03b1-positive as well as ER\u03b1-negative tumors. Furthermore, AIB1 amplification characterizes a subgroup of ER\u03b1-positive breast cancer with worse outcome. Therefore, AIB1 might be helpful to identify those ER\u03b1-positive breast cancers patients who are candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy.",

                      "abstract": "AIB1 (amplified in breast cancer 1) is an estrogen receptor\u03b1 (ER\u03b1) co-activator, known to be amplified and overexpressed in a fraction of breast cancers. It has been linked to prognosis and tamoxifen resistance. However, results have been ambiguous. The different functions of AIB1 in ER\u03b1-positive and -negative disease are poorly understood. Therefore, we analyzed the clinical significance of AIB1 in breast cancer with respect to ER\u03b1-status and characterized the subgroups. 2,197 breast carcinomas sampled on a pre-existing tissue microarray (TMA) were analyzed for AIB1 expression and amplification by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).AIB1 expression was detected in 60\u00a0% of the tumors. It was associated with tumor size (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003), high histological grade (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), poor disease-specific, and overall survival (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0018 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.003). There was a strong inverse relationship between AIB1 and ER\u03b1 expression (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). AIB1 overexpression was associated with increased Ki67 labeling index (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), even if analyzed for different ER expression levels. AIB1 amplification was found in 11\u00a0% of the carcinomas. It was associated with high histological grade (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0012), lymph node involvement (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0163), and poor disease-specific survival (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0032) but not with overall survival (p\u00a0=\u00a00.1672) or ER status (p\u00a0=\u00a00.4456). If ER-positive tumors were stratified according to their AIB1 amplification status, there was a significant worse disease-specific survival in cases showing AIB1 amplification (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0017). AIB1 expression is associated with unfavorable prognosis and tumor phenotype. It seems to unfold its oncogenic potential at least in part independent from its role as an ER\u03b1 co-activator. AIB1 has an impact on cell cycle regulation in ER\u03b1-positive as well as ER\u03b1-negative tumors. Furthermore, AIB1 amplification characterizes a subgroup of ER\u03b1-positive breast cancer with worse outcome. Therefore, AIB1 might be helpful to identify those ER\u03b1-positive breast cancers patients who are candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy.",

Very little is currently known about the mutations that drive aggressive cSCC.Whole-exome sequencing was performed on 39 cases of aggressive cSCC to identify driver genes and novel therapeutic targets. Significantly, mutated genes were identified with MutSig or complementary methods developed to specifically identify candidate tumor suppressors based upon their inactivating mutation bias.Despite the very high-mutational background caused by UV exposure, 23 candidate drivers were identified, including the well-known cancer-associated genes TP53, CDKN2A, NOTCH1, AJUBA, HRAS, CASP8, FAT1, and KMT2C (MLL3). Three novel candidate tumor suppressors with putative links to cancer or differentiation, NOTCH2, PARD3, and RASA1, were also identified as possible drivers in cSCC. KMT2C mutations were associated with poor outcome and increased bone invasion.The mutational spectrum of cSCC is similar to that of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and dominated by tumor-suppressor genes. These results improve the foundation for understanding this disease and should aid in identifying and treating aggressive cSCC.",

Moderate to high expression of PARP1 and PARP2 is observed in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST). Treatment with AZD2281, a PARP1 inhibitor, significantly increased the survival of mice with metastatic disease.

Trabectedin is an isoquinoline alkylating agent with a peculiar mechanism of action. It binds to minor groove of DNA inducing single- and double-strand-breaks. These kinds of damage lead to the activation of PARP1, a first-line enzyme in DNA-damage response pathways. We hypothesized that PARP1 targeting could perpetuate trabectedin-induced DNA damage in tumor cells leading finally to cell death.We investigated trabectedin and PARP1 inhibitor synergism in several tumor histotypes both in vitro and in vivo (subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor xenografts in mice). We searched for key determinants of drug synergism by comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and gene expression profiling (GEP) and validated their functional role.Trabectedin activated PARP1 enzyme and the combination with PARP1 inhibitors potentiated DNA damage, cell cycle arrest at G2/M checkpoint and apoptosis, if compared to single agents. Olaparib was the most active PARP1 inhibitor to combine with trabectedin and we confirmed the antitumor and antimetastatic activity of trabectedin/olaparib combination in mice models. However, we observed different degree of trabectedin/olaparib synergism among different cell lines. Namely, in DMR leiomyosarcoma models the combination was significantly more active than single agents, while in SJSA-1 osteosarcoma models no further advantage was obtained if compared to trabectedin alone. aCGH and GEP revealed that key components of DNA-repair pathways were involved in trabectedin/olaparib synergism. In particular, PARP1 expression dictated the degree of the synergism. Indeed, trabectedin/olaparib synergism was increased after PARP1 overexpression and reduced after PARP1 silencing.PARP1 inhibition potentiated trabectedin activity in a PARP1-dependent manner and PARP1 expression in tumor cells might be a useful predictive biomarker that deserves clinical evaluation.', 'ascoAbstractId': None, 'authorString': \"Ymera Pignochino, Federica Capozzi, Lorenzo D'Ambrosio, Carmine Dell'Aglio, Marco Basiric\u00f2, Marta Canta, Annalisa Lorenzato, Francesca Vignolo Lutati, Sandra Aliberti, Erica Palesandro, Paola Boccone, Danilo Galizia, Sara Miano, Giulia Chiabotto, Lucia Napione, Loretta Gammaitoni, Dario Sangiolo, Maria Serena Benassi, Barbara Pasini, Giovanna Chiorino, Massimo Aglietta, Giovanni Grignani\", 'citation': 'Pignochino et al., 2017', 'citationId': '28454547', 'clinicalTrials': [], 'comments': {'edges': []}, 'displayType': 'PubMed', 'events': {'edges': []}, 'fullJournalTitle': 'Molecular cancer', 'fullyCurated': False, 'id': 3159, 'journal': 'Mol Cancer', 'lastCommentEvent': None, 'link': '/sources/3159', 'name': 'PubMed: Pignochino et al., 2017', 'openAccess': True, 'pmcId': 'PMC5410089', 'publicationDate': '2017-4-28', 'publicationDay': 28, 'publicationMonth': 4, 'publicationYear': 2017, 'sourceType': 'PUBMED', 'sourceUrl': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28454547', 'title': 'PARP1 expression drives the synergistic antitumor activity of trabectedin and PARP1 inhibitors in sarcoma preclinical models.', 'citation_count': 31, 'MeSH_terms': ['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'DNA Damage', 'Dioxoles', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Phthalazines', 'Piperazines', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1', 'Sarcoma', 'Tetrahydroisoquinolines', 'Trabectedin', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']}, 'status': 'SUBMITTED', 'therapies': [{'id': 6356}, {'id': 42}], 'therapyInteractionType': 'COMBINATION', 'variantOrigin': 'NA'}}}}}, '3659': {'gene_name': 'MTAP', 'geneAliases': ['BDMF', 'DMSFH', 'DMSMFH', 'HEL-249', 'LGMBF', 'MSAP', 'MTAP', 'c86fus'], 'gene_official_name': 'methylthioadenosine phosphorylase', 'gene_description': '', 'gene_summary': 'This gene encodes an enzyme that plays a major role in polyamine metabolism and is important for the salvage of both adenine and methionine.

Very little is currently known about the mutations that drive aggressive cSCC.Whole-exome sequencing was performed on 39 cases of aggressive cSCC to identify driver genes and novel therapeutic targets. Significantly, mutated genes were identified with MutSig or complementary methods developed to specifically identify candidate tumor suppressors based upon their inactivating mutation bias.Despite the very high-mutational background caused by UV exposure, 23 candidate drivers were identified, including the well-known cancer-associated genes TP53, CDKN2A, NOTCH1, AJUBA, HRAS, CASP8, FAT1, and KMT2C (MLL3). Three novel candidate tumor suppressors with putative links to cancer or differentiation, NOTCH2, PARD3, and RASA1, were also identified as possible drivers in cSCC. KMT2C mutations were associated with poor outcome and increased bone invasion.The mutational spectrum of cSCC is similar to that of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and dominated by tumor-suppressor genes.

These master-regulatory functions of ER\u03b1 require trans-acting elements such as the pioneer factor FOXA1 to establish a genomic landscape conducive to ER\u03b1 control. Here, we identify the H3K4 methyltransferase KMT2C as necessary for hormone-driven ER\u03b1 activity and breast cancer proliferation. KMT2C knockdown suppresses estrogen-dependent gene expression and causes H3K4me1 and H3K27ac loss selectively at ER\u03b1 enhancers. Correspondingly, KMT2C loss impairs estrogen-driven breast cancer proliferation but has no effect on ER- breast cells. Whereas KMT2C loss disrupts estrogen-driven proliferation, it conversely promotes tumor outgrowth under hormone-depleted conditions. In accordance, KMT2C is one of the most frequently mutated genes in ER-positive breast cancer with KMT2C deletion correlating with significantly shorter progression-free survival on anti-estrogen therapy. From a therapeutic standpoint, KMT2C-depleted cells that develop hormone-independence retain their dependence on ER\u03b1, displaying ongoing sensitivity to ER\u03b1 antagonists.

Limited effective options are available for un-resectable or metastatic DFSP beyond targeting the oncogenic PDGF pathway with imatinib therapy. We established a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and cell line model (designated MDFSP-S1) of imatinib-resistant DFSP with fibro-sarcomatous transformation. Whole genome sequencing identified high-level amplification at chromosomes 17 and 22, whilst homozygous deep deletion was demonstrated at chromosome 9 (CDKN2A, CDKN2B, MTAP). RNA sequencing followed by Sanger sequencing confirmed the pathognomonic COL1A1-PDGFB t (17;22) rearrangement in the original tumour, PDX and cell line model. Immunohistochemistry profiles of the PDX model were consistent with the patient's tumour sample (CD34\\u2009+\\u2009/MIB1\\u2009+\\u2009/SOX10-\\u2009). Gene set enrichment analysis highlighted top-scoring Hallmark gene sets in several oncogenic signalling pathways, including potentially targetable MTORC1 signalling and angiogenesis pathways. Antiangiogenic agents (sunitinib, regorafenib, pazopanib, axitinib) and the third-generation irreversible epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor osimertinib exhibited modest anti-proliferative activity in the cell line, with IC50 values between 1 and 10\\xa0\u00b5M at 72\\xa0h. No significant activity was observed with imatinib, palbociclib, everolimus, olaparib, gefitinib and erlotinib (IC50 all\\u2009>\\u200910\\xa0\u00b5M). In conclusion, we established MDFSP-S1, a new PDX and cell line model of imatinib-resistant DFSP with fibro-sarcomatous transformation.\", '1': 'We analyzed the oncogenic potential of RET \u0394898-901 mutant and its response to selpercatinib, vandetanib, and cabozantinib in vitro and in a clinical case. A 35-year-old man with a medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) harboring a somatic D898_E901 <i>RET</i> deletion was sequentially treated with vandetanib, selpercatinib, cabozantinib, and fluorouracil (5-FU)-dacarbazine. Functional study of RET \u0394898-901 mutant was performed in HEK-293T, NIH-3T3, and Ba/F3 cells. RET C634R and wild-type cells served as positive and negative controls, respectively. The patient showed primary resistance to vandetanib and secondary resistance to selpercatinib after 12 months. Comprehensive next-generation sequencing of a progressing lesion during selpercatinib showed no additional RET mutation but an acquired complete genetic loss of <i>CDKN2A</i>, <i>CDKN2B,</i> and <i>MTAP</i> genes. Subsequent treatment with cabozantinib and 5-FU-dacarbazine had poor efficacy. In vitro, RET \u0394898-901 showed higher ligand-independent RET autophosphorylation compared with RET C634R and similar proliferation rates in cell models. Subcutaneous injection of \u0394898-901 NIH 3T3 cells in nude mice produced tumors of around 500 mm<sup>3</sup> in 2 weeks, similarly to RET C634R cells. Selpercatinib inhibited cell growth of Ba/F3 RET \u0394898-901 and RET C634R with a similar half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of approximately 3 nM. Vandetanib was five-fold less effective at inhibiting cell growth promoted by RET \u0394898-901 mutant (IC<sub>50</sub>, 564 nM) compared with RET C634R one (IC<sub>50</sub>, 91 nM). Cabozantinib efficiently inhibited Ba/F3 RET C634 proliferation (IC<sub>50</sub>, 25.9 nM), but was scarcely active in Ba/F3 RET 898-901 (IC<sub>50</sub> > 1,350 nM). D898_E901 <i>RET</i> deletion is a gain-of-function mutation and responds to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in MTC. RET \u0394898-901 mutant is sensitive to selpercatinib and vandetanib, and acquired resistance to selpercatinib may develop via RET-independent mechanisms.', '2': 'Lipoblastoma-like tumor (LLT) is a rare adipocytic neoplasm with a predilection for the vulva. Since 2002, <30 cases have been reported, characterizing it as an indolent tumor that may sometimes recur locally. Diagnosis can be challenging due to its rarity and morphologic overlap with other adipocytic tumors. Thus far, there are no specific molecular or immunohistochemical features to aid in the diagnosis of LLT. Recent case reports have described LLT arising at other sites, including the spermatic cord and gluteal region, suggesting wider anatomical distribution. We present a large series of LLT to further characterize its clinicopathologic and molecular features. Twenty-eight cases of LLT were retrieved from departmental and consult archives (including 8 from a prior series). The cohort comprised 28 patients (8 males, 20 females) with a median age of 28 years (range: 1-80 years). There were 17 primary LLT of the vulva. Other anatomical sites included the scrotum (n\\xa0= 3), spermatic cord (n\\xa0= 2), inguinal region (n\\xa0= 2), limbs (n\\xa0= 2), pelvis (n\\xa0= 1), and retroperitoneum (n\\xa0= 1). Median tumor size was 6.0 cm (range: 1.8-30.0 cm). The tumors had a lobulated architecture and were typically composed of adipocytes, lipoblasts, and spindle cells in a myxoid stroma with prominent thin-walled vessels. Using immunohistochemistry, a subset showed loss of Rb expression (12/23 of samples). Follow-up in 15 patients (median: 56 months) revealed 8 patients with local recurrence and 1 patient with metastases to the lung/pleura and breasts. Targeted DNA sequencing revealed a simple genomic profile with limited copy number alterations and low mutational burden. No alterations in RB1 were identified. The metastatic LLT showed concurrent pathogenic PIK3CA and MTOR activating mutations, both in the primary and in the lung/pleural metastasis; the latter also harbored TERT promoter mutation. One tumor had a pathogenic TSC1 mutation, and one tumor showed 2-copy deletion of CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and MTAP. No biologically significant variants were identified in 8 tumors. No gene fusions were identified by RNA sequencing in 4 tumors successfully sequenced. This study expands the clinicopathologic spectrum of LLT, highlighting its wider anatomical distribution and potential for occasional metastasis. Molecularly, we identified activating mutations in the PI3K-MTOR signaling pathway in 2 tumors, which may contribute to exceptional aggressive behavior.', '3': 'Homozygous deletion of <i>MTAP</i> upregulates <i>de novo</i> synthesis of purine (DNSP) and increases the proliferation of neoplastic cells. This increases the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to DNSP inhibitors such as methotrexate, L-alanosine and pemetrexed. 7,301 cases of MBC underwent hybrid-capture based comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP). Tumor mutational burden (TMB) was determined on up to 1.1 Mb of sequenced DNA and microsatellite instability (MSI) was determined on 114 loci. Tumor cell PD-L1 expression was determined by IHC (Dako 22C3). 208 (2.84%) of MBC featured <i>MTAP</i> loss. <i>MTAP</i> loss patients were younger (<i>p</i> = 0.002) and were more frequently ER- (30% vs. 50%; <i>p</i> < 0.0001), triple negative (TNBC) (47% vs. 27%; <i>p</i> < 0.0001) and less frequently HER2+ (2% vs. 8%; <i>p</i> = 0.0001) than <i>MTAP</i> intact MBC. Lobular histology and <i>CDH1</i> mutations were more frequent in <i>MTAP</i> intact (14%) than <i>MTAP</i> loss MBC (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). <i>CDKN2A</i> (100%) and <i>CDKN2B</i> (97%) loss (9p21 co-deletion) were significantly associated with <i>MTAP</i> loss (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). Likely associated with the increased TNBC cases, BRCA1 mutation was also more frequent in <i>MTAP</i> loss MBC (10% vs. 4%; <i>p</i> < 0.0001). As for immune checkpoint inhibitors biomarkers, higher TMB >20 mut/Mb levels in the <i>MTAP</i> intact MBC (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) and higher PD-L1 low expression (1-49% TPS) in the <i>MTAP</i> loss <i>MTAP</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.002) were observed. <i>MTAP</i> loss in MBC has distinct clinical features with genomic alterations (GA) affecting both targeted and immunotherapies. Further efforts are necessary to identify alternative means of targeting PRMT5 and MTA2 in <i>MTAP</i>-ve cancers to benefit from the high-MTA environment of <i>MTAP</i>-deficient cancers.', '4': \"Advanced urothelial carcinoma continues to have a dismal prognosis despite several new therapies in the last 5 years. <i>FGFR2</i> and <i>FGFR3</i> mutations and fusions, PD-L1 expression, tumor mutational burden, and microsatellite instability are established predictive biomarkers in advanced urothelial carcinoma. Novel biomarkers can optimize the sequencing of available treatments and improve outcomes. We describe herein the clinical and pathologic features of patients with an emerging subtype of bladder cancer characterized by deletion of the gene <i>MTAP</i> encoding the enzyme S-Methyl-5'-thioadenosine phosphatase, a potential biomarker of response to pemetrexed. We performed a retrospective analysis of 61 patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma for whom demographics, pathologic specimens, next generation sequencing, and clinical outcomes were available. We compared the frequency of histology variants, upper tract location, pathogenic gene variants, tumor response, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) between patients with tumors harboring <i>MTAP</i> deletion (<i>MTAP</i>-del) and wild type tumors (<i>MTAP</i>-WT). A propensity score matching of 5 covariates (age, gender, presence of variant histology, prior surgery, and prior non-muscle invasive bladder cancer) was calculated to compensate for disparity when comparing survival in these subgroups. Non-supervised clustering analysis of differentially expressed genes between <i>MTAP</i>-del and <i>MTAP</i>-WT urothelial carcinomas was performed. <i>MTAP</i>-del occurred in 19 patients (31%). Tumors with <i>MTAP</i>-del were characterized by higher prevalence of squamous differentiation (47.4 vs 11.9%), bone metastases (52.6 vs 23.5%) and lower frequency of upper urinary tract location (5.2% vs 26.1%). Pathway gene set enrichment analysis showed that among the genes upregulated in the <i>MTAP</i>-del cohort, at least 5 were linked to keratinization (FOXN1, KRT33A/B, KRT84, RPTN) possibly contributing to the higher prevalence of squamous differentiation. Alterations in the PIK3 and MAPK pathways were more frequent when <i>MTAP</i> was deleted. There was a trend to inferior response to chemotherapy among <i>MTAP</i>-del tumors, but no difference in the response to immune checkpoint inhibitors or enfortumab. Median progression free survival after first line therapy (PFS1) was 5.5 months for patients with <i>MTAP</i>-WT and 4.5 months for patients with <i>MTAP</i>-del (HR = 1.30; 95% CI, 0.64-2.63; P = 0.471). There was no difference in the time from metastatic diagnosis to death (P = 0.6346). Median OS from diagnosis of localized or de novo metastatic disease was 16 months (range 1.5-60, IQR 8-26) for patients with MTAP-del and 24.5 months (range 3-156, IQR 16-48) for patients with MTAP-WT (P = 0.0218), suggesting that time to progression to metastatic disease is shorter in MTAP-del patients. Covariates did not impact significantly overall survival on propensity score matching. In conclusion, MTAP -del occurs in approximately 30% of patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma and defines a subgroup of patients with aggressive features, such as squamous differentiation, frequent bone metastases, poor response to chemotherapy, and shorter time to progression to metastatic disease.\", '5': 'When urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) presents or progresses to chemo-refractory metastatic disease, the search for new therapeutic targets is paramount. Targeting protein arginine methyltransferase 5 accumulation in tumors with methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) genomic loss has been proposed as a new anti-tumor strategy. We evaluated the incidence of patients with MTAP loss and correlate to treatment-guiding targets and biomarkers. Two thousand six hundred eighty-three cases of advanced UCB underwent hybrid-capture based comprehensive genomic profiling using the FDA-approved F1CDx assay to evaluate all classes of genomic alterations (GA) among 324 genes. Tumor mutational burden was determined on at least 0.8 Mbp of sequenced DNA and microsatellite instability was determined on at least 95 loci. 650 (24%) of UCB featured MTAP loss mutations (MTAP-). The gene and age distributions were similar in MTAP intact (MTAP+) and MTAP- UCB. MTAP- UCB contained higher GA/tumor frequency than MTAP+ UCB likely reflecting the frequent co-deletions of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A/B. Of potential therapeutic targets, fibroblast growth factor receptor 3, and phosphatase and tensin homolog GA were more frequent in MTAP- UCB. In contrast, biomarkers of immunotherapy response, including higher frequencies of high tumor mutational burden and high programmed death-ligand 1 IHC staining, were observed in the MTAP+ UCB. When compared with MTAP+ UCB, MTAP- UCB differs in genomic signatures including an increase in potentially targetable alterations but a lower frequency of immunotherapy drug biomarkers. Thus, the genomic landscape in MTAP- UCB may play a role in the design of clinical trials incorporating combination treatment strategies when targeting protein arginine methyltransferase 5 in MTAP- tumors.', '6': \"5'-Methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) is a key enzyme in the methionine salvage pathway and has been reported to suppress tumorigenesis. The MTAP gene is located at 9p21, a chromosome region often deleted in breast cancer (BC). However, the clinical and biological significance of MTAP in BC is still unclear. Here, we reported that MTAP was frequently downregulated in 41% (35/85) of primary BCs and 89% (8/9) of BC cell lines. Low expression of MTAP was significantly correlated with a poor survival of BC patients (P=0.0334). Functional studies showed that MTAP was able to suppress both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> tumorigenic ability of BC cells, including migration, invasion, angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastasis in nude mice with orthotopic xenograft tumor of BC. Mechanistically, we found that downregulation of MTAP could increase the polyamine levels by activating ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). By treating the MTAP-repressing BC cells with specific ODC inhibitor Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) or treating the MTAP-overexpressing BC cells with additional putrescine, metastasis-promoting or -suppressing phenotype of these MTAP-manipulated cells was significantly reversed, respectively. Taken together, our data suggested that MTAP has a critical metastasis-suppressive role by tightly regulating ODC activity in BC cells, which may serve as a prominent novel therapeutic target for advanced breast cancer treatment.\", '7': 'Diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) bearing driver mutations of histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27M) are incurable brain tumors with unique epigenomes. Here, we generated a syngeneic H3K27M mouse model to study the amino acid metabolic dependencies of these tumors. H3K27M mutant cells were highly dependent on methionine. Interrogating the methionine cycle dependency through a short-interfering RNA screen identified the enzyme methionine adenosyltransferase 2A (MAT2A) as a critical vulnerability in these tumors. This vulnerability was not mediated through the canonical mechanism of MTAP deletion; instead, DMG cells have lower levels of MAT2A protein, which is mediated by negative feedback induced by the metabolite decarboxylated S-adenosyl methionine. Depletion of residual MAT2A induces global depletion of H3K36me3, a chromatin mark of transcriptional elongation perturbing oncogenic and developmental transcriptional programs. Moreover, methionine-restricted diets extended survival in multiple models of DMG in vivo. Collectively, our results suggest that MAT2A presents an exploitable therapeutic vulnerability in H3K27M gliomas.', '8': \"Genetic alterations in FGF/FGFR pathway are infrequent in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), with rare cases of quadruple wildtype GISTs harboring FGFR1 gene fusions and mutations. Additionally, FGF/FGFR overexpression was shown to promote drug resistance to kinase inhibitors in GISTs. However, FGFR gene fusions have not been directly implicated as a mechanism of drug resistance in GISTs. Herein, we report a patient presenting with a primary small bowel spindle cell GIST and concurrent peritoneal and liver metastases displaying an imatinib-sensitive KIT exon 11 in-frame deletion. After an initial 9-month benefit to imatinib, the patient experienced intraabdominal peritoneal recurrence owing to secondary KIT exon 13 missense mutation and FGFR4 amplification. Despite several additional rounds of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), the patient's disease progressed after 2\\u2009years and presented with multiple peritoneal and liver metastases, including one pericolonic mass harboring secondary KIT exon 18 missense mutation, and a concurrent transverse colonic mass with a FGFR2::TACC2 fusion and AKT2 amplification. All tumors, including primary and recurrent masses, harbored an MGA c.7272\\u2009T\\u2009>\\u2009G (p.Y2424*) nonsense mutation and CDKN2A/CDKN2B/MTAP deletions. The transcolonic mass showed elevated mitotic count (18/10 HPF), as well as significant decrease in CD117 and DOG1 expression, in contrast to all the other resistant nodules that displayed diffuse and strong CD117 and DOG1 immunostaining. The FGFR2::TACC2 fusion resulted from a 742\\u2009kb intrachromosomal inversion at the chr10q26.3 locus, leading to a fusion between exons 1-17 of FGFR2 and exons 7-17 TACC2, which preserves the extracellular and protein tyrosine kinase domains of FGFR2. We present the first report of a multidrug-resistant GIST patient who developed an FGFR2 gene fusion as a secondary genetic event to the selective pressure of various TKIs. This case also highlights the heterogeneous escape mechanisms to targeted therapy across various tumor nodules, spanning from both KIT-dependent and KIT-independent off-target activation pathways.\", '9': 'The overall survival of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains poor and its incidence is rising. Targetable mutations in PDAC are rare, thus novel therapeutic approaches are needed. Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) overexpression is associated with worse survival and inhibition of PRMT5 results in decreased cancer growth across multiple cancers, including PDAC. Emerging evidence also suggests that altered RNA processing is a driver in PDAC tumorigenesis and creates a partial dependency on this process. PRMT5 inhibition induces altered splicing and this vulnerability can be exploited as a novel therapeutic approach. Three possible biological pathways underpinning the action of PRMT5 inhibitors are discussed; c-Myc regulation appears central to its action in the PDAC setting. Whilst homozygous MTAP deletion and symmetrical dimethylation levels are associated with increased sensitivity to PRMT5 inhibition, neither measure robustly predicts its growth inhibitory response. The immunomodulatory effect of PRMT5 inhibitors on the tumour microenvironment will also be discussed, based on emerging evidence that PDAC stroma has a significant bearing on disease behaviour and response to therapy. Lastly, with the above caveats in mind, current knowledge gaps and the implications and rationales for PRMT5 inhibitor development in PDAC will be explored.'}, 'Publication Date': {'0': '2023-08-23', '1': 'Not available', '2': '2023-06-22', '3': '2023-03-11', '4': '2023-01-15', '5': '2022-11-25', '6': '2022-04-24', '7': '2022-04-14', '8': '2022-02-22', '9': '2021-10-13'}, 'DOI': {'0': '10.1007/s13577-023-00974-8', '1': '10.1200/PO.23.00052', '2': '10.1016/j.modpat.2023.100252', '3': '10.18632/oncotarget.28376', '4': 'Not available', '5': '10.1016/j.urolonc.2022.10.001', '6': '10.7150/ijbs.67149', '7': '10.1038/s43018-022-00348-3', '8': '10.1002/gcc.23030', '9': '10.3390/cancers13205136'}, 'Citation Counts': {'0': 1, '1': 0, '2': 0, '3': 0, '4': 2, '5': 4, '6': 5, '7': 6, '8': 3, '9': 7}, 'MeSH terms': {'0': '', '1': 'Animals, Mice, Humans, Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret, Mice, Nude, Thyroid Neoplasms, Piperidines, Fluorouracil, Dacarbazine', '2': '', '3': 'Humans, B7-H1 Antigen, Homozygote, Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms, Sequence Deletion, Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase, Genomics, Histone Deacetylases, Repressor Proteins, Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases', '4': '', '5': 'Humans, Carcinoma, Transitional Cell, Urinary Bladder Neoplasms, Synthetic Lethal Mutations, Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases, Genomics', '6': 'Animals, Breast Neoplasms, Down-Regulation, Female, Heterografts, Humans, Mice, Mice, Nude, Ornithine Decarboxylase, Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase', '7': 'Animals, Brain Neoplasms, Epigenome, Glioma, Histones, Methionine, Methionine Adenosyltransferase, Mice', '8': 'Antineoplastic Agents, Carrier Proteins, Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors, Gene Fusion, Humans, Imatinib Mesylate, Liver Neoplasms, Mutation, Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit, Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 2, Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha, Tumor Suppressor Proteins', '9': ''}}}, '14089': {'2297': {'Title': {'0': 'Genomic landscape of patients with germline RUNX1 variants and familial platelet disorder with myeloid malignancy.', '1': 'Intestinal-Type Adenocarcinoma in Head and Neck: Dissecting Oncogenic Gene Alterations Through Whole Transcriptome and Exome Analysis.', '2': 'Genomic Landscape of Patients with Germline <i>RUNX1</i> Variants and Familial Platelet Disorder with Myeloid Malignancy.', '3': 'The Identification by Exome Sequencing of Candidate Genes in <i>BRCA</i>-Negative Tunisian Patients at a High Risk of Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer.', '4': 'Identification of Altered Genes in Gallbladder Cancer as Potential Driver Mutations for Diagnostic and Prognostic Purposes: A Computational Approach.', '5': 'Gene alterations in epigenetic modifiers and JAK-STAT signaling are frequent in breast implant-associated ALCL.', '6': 'Genomic characterization of metastatic breast cancers.', '7': 'A knowledge-based framework for the discovery of cancer-predisposing variants using large-scale sequencing breast cancer data.'}, 'Authors': {'0': 'Kai Yu;

We recently launched a longitudinal natural history study for patients with FPDMM. Among 27 families with research genomic data by the end of 2021, 26 different germline RUNX1 variants were detected. Besides missense mutations enriched in Runt homology domain and loss-of-function mutations distributed throughout the gene, splice-region mutations and large deletions were detected in 6 and 7 families, respectively. In 25 of 51 (49%) patients without hematologic malignancy, somatic mutations were detected in at least 1 of the clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) genes or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) driver genes. BCOR was the most frequently mutated gene (in 9 patients), and multiple BCOR mutations were identified in 4 patients. Mutations in 6 other CHIP- or AML-driver genes (TET2, DNMT3A, KRAS, LRP1B, IDH1, and KMT2C) were also found in \u22652 patients without hematologic malignancy. Moreover, 3 unrelated patients (1 with myeloid malignancy) carried somatic mutations in NFE2, which regulates erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation. Sequential sequencing data from 19 patients demonstrated dynamic changes of somatic mutations over time, and stable clones were more frequently found in older adult patients. In summary, there are diverse types of germline RUNX1 mutations and high frequency of somatic mutations related to clonal hematopoiesis in patients with FPDMM. Monitoring changes in somatic mutations and clinical manifestations prospectively may reveal mechanisms for malignant progression and inform clinical management. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT03854318.', '1': 'Adenocarcinomas of the nasal/paranasal sinuses are uncommon, but intestinal-type adenocarcinomas (ITACs) are important. Due to the rarity of these tumors, their molecular profile is not well known. To further investigate the molecular profile and find potential oncogenic drivers, we compared the whole transcriptome and exome of ITACs at different anatomic locations in the head and neck. Twenty-one head and neck adenocarcinomas were used in this study, divided into 10 sinonasal adenocarcinomas (SNT) and 11 extrasinonasal (T) head and neck adenocarcinomas according to anatomic location and histology. Tumor samples along with normal mucosa were microdissected from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples, and RNA and DNA were subjected to whole-transcriptome and -exome shotgun sequencing. Analysis of ITACs at sinonasal locations showed 410 subtype-specific differentially expressed (DE) genes and noncoding transcripts compared with the group of other anatomic locations, with 2909 subtype-specific DE genes. The groups shared 872 genes, with 17 highly different or opposing DE genes. Whole-exome mutation analysis revealed the gene MLL3 (KMT2C) to be exhibiting the most frequent loss-of-function mutations in all adenocarcinomas investigated. The results suggest that the head and neck ITACs investigated were mainly caused by loss-of-function mutations in MLL3 that disabled chromatin methylation and remodeling of all MLL3-targeted enhancers in the tumors. This changed the activity of multiple genes/gene clusters, supporting oncogenicity mostly via pathways of signaling, dedifferentiation, proliferation, migration, and immune and inflammatory deregulation, indicating a truly epigenetic event as the root cause for the heterogenous diversity of these enteric types of cancer. The data of this study form the basis for understanding cell fate determination and cellular homeostasis in the normal respiratory mucosa at different anatomic sites and show the contribution of different mucosal components to the etiology/molecular pathology of ITAC.', '2': 'Germline <i>RUNX1</i> mutations lead to familial platelet disorder with associated myeloid malignancies (FPDMM), which is characterized by thrombocytopenia and a life-long risk (35-45%) of hematological malignancies.

Among 29 families with research genomic data, 28 different germline <i>RUNX1</i> variants were detected. Besides missense mutations enriched in Runt homology domain and loss-of-function mutations distributed throughout the gene, splice-region mutations and large deletions were detected in 6 and 7 families, respectively.

Comprehensive genomic profile of patients with FPDMM with germline <i>RUNX1</i> mutations. Rising clonal hematopoiesis related secondary mutations that may lead to myeloid malignancies.', '3': '(1) Background: Germline variants in <i>BRCA1/BRCA2</i> genes explain about 20% of hereditary breast/ovarian cancer (HBOC) cases. In the present paper, we aim to identify genetic determinants in <i>BRCA</i>-negative families from the South of Tunisia. (2) Methods: Exome Sequencing (ES) was performed on the lymphocyte DNA of patients negative for <i>BRCA</i> mutations from each Tunisian family with a high risk of HBOC. (3) Results: We focus on the canonical genes associated with HBOC and identified missense variants in DNA damage response genes, such as <i>ATM</i>, <i>RAD52</i>, and <i>RAD54</i>; however, no variants in <i>PALB2</i>, <i>Chek2</i>, and <i>TP53</i> genes were found. To identify novel candidate genes, we selected variants harboring a loss of function and identified 17 stop-gain and 11 frameshift variants in genes not commonly known to be predisposed to HBOC. Then, we focus on rare and high-impact genes shared by at least 3 unrelated patients from each family and selected 16 gene variants. Through combined data analysis from MCODE with gene ontology and KEGG pathways, a short list of eight candidate genes (<i>ATM</i>, <i>EP300</i>, <i>LAMA1</i>, <i>LAMC2</i>, <i>TNNI3</i>, <i>MYLK</i>, <i>COL11A2</i>, and <i>LAMB3</i>) was created. The impact of the 24 selected genes on survival was analyzed using the TCGA data resulting in a selection of five candidate genes (<i>EP300</i>, <i>KMT2C</i>, <i>RHPN2</i>, <i>HSPG2</i>, and <i>CCR3)</i> that showed a significant association with survival. (4) Conclusions: We identify novel candidate genes predisposed to HBOC that need to be validated in larger cohorts and investigated by analyzing the co-segregation of selected variants in affected families and the locus-specific loss of heterozygosity to highlight their relevance for HBOC risk.', '4': 'Prognostic markers for cancer can assist in the evaluation of survival probability of patients and help clinicians to assess the available treatment modalities. Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is a rare tumor that causes 165\\u2009087 deaths in the world annually. It is the most common cancer of the biliary tract and has a particularly high incidence in Chile, Japan, and northern India. Currently, there is no accurate diagnosis test or effective molecular markers for GBC identification. Several studies have focused on the discovery of genetic alterations in important genes associated with GBC to propose novel diagnosis pathways and to create prognostic profiles. To achieve this, we performed data-mining of GBC in public repositories, harboring 133 samples of GBC, allowing us to describe relevant somatic mutations in important genes and to propose a genetic alteration atlas for GBC. In our results, we reported the 14 most altered genes in GBC: <i>arid1a, arid2, atm, ctnnb1, erbb2, erbb3, kmt2c, kmt2d, kras, pik3ca, smad4, tert, tp53</i>, and <i>znf521</i> in samples from Japan, the United States, Chile, and China. Missense mutations are common among these genes. The annotations of many mutations revealed their importance in cancer development. The observed annotations mentioned that several mutations found in this repository are probably oncogenic, with a putative loss-of-function. In addition, they are hotspot mutations and are probably linked to poor prognosis in other cancers. We identified another 11 genes, which presented a copy number alteration in gallbladder database samples, which are <i>ccnd1, ccnd3, ccne1, cdk12, cdkn2a, cdkn2b, erbb2, erbb3, kras, mdm2</i>, and <i>myc</i>. The findings reported here can help to detect GBC cancer through the development of systems based on genetic alterations, for example, the development of a mutation panel specifically for GBC diagnosis, as well as the creation of prognostic profiles to accomplish the development of GBC and its prevalence.', '5': 'The oncogenic events involved in breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BI-ALCL) remain elusive. To clarify this point, we have characterized the genomic landscape of 34 BI-ALCLs (15 tumor and 19 in situ subtypes) collected from 54 BI-ALCL patients diagnosed through the French Lymphopath network. Whole-exome sequencing (n = 22, with paired tumor/germline DNA) and/or targeted deep sequencing (n = 24) showed recurrent mutations of epigenetic modifiers in 74% of cases, involving notably KMT2C (26%), KMT2D (9%), CHD2 (15%), and CREBBP (15%). KMT2D and KMT2C mutations correlated with a loss of H3K4 mono- and trimethylation by immunohistochemistry. Twenty cases (59%) showed mutations in \u22651 member of the JAK/STAT pathway, including STAT3 (38%), JAK1 (18%), and STAT5B (3%), and in negative regulators, including SOCS3 (6%), SOCS1 (3%), and PTPN1 (3%). These mutations were more frequent in tumor-type samples than in situ samples (P = .038). All BI-ALCLs expressed pSTAT3, regardless of the mutational status of genes in the JAK/STAT pathway. Mutations in the EOMES gene (12%) involved in lymphocyte development, PI3K-AKT/mTOR (6%), and loss-of-function mutations in TP53 (12%) were also identified. Copy-number aberration (CNA) analysis identified recurrent alterations, including gains on chromosomes 2, 9p, 12p, and 21 and losses on 4q, 8p, 15, 16, and 20. Regions of CNA encompassed genes involved in the JAK/STAT pathway and epigenetic regulators. Our results show that the BI-ALCL genomic landscape is characterized by not only JAK/STAT activating mutations but also loss-of-function alterations of epigenetic modifiers.', '6': 'Metastasis is the main cause of death for patients with breast cancer. Many studies have characterized the genomic landscape of breast cancer during its early stages. However, there is evidence that genomic alterations are acquired during the evolution of cancers from their early to late stages, and that the genomic landscape of early cancers is not representative of that of lethal cancers<sup>1-7</sup>. Here we investigated the landscape of somatic alterations in 617 metastatic breast cancers. Nine driver genes (TP53, ESR1, GATA3, KMT2C, NCOR1, AKT1, NF1, RIC8A and RB1) were more frequently mutated in metastatic breast cancers that expressed hormone receptors (oestrogen and/or progesterone receptors; HR<sup>+</sup>) but did not have high levels of HER2 (HER2<sup>-</sup>; n\\xa0=\\xa0381), when compared to early breast cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas. In addition, 18 amplicons were more frequently observed in HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>-</sup> metastatic breast cancers. These cancers showed an increase in mutational signatures S2, S3, S10, S13 and S17. Among the gene alterations that were enriched in HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>-</sup> metastatic breast cancers, mutations in TP53, RB1 and NF1, together with S10, S13 and S17, were associated with poor outcome. Metastatic triple-negative breast cancers showed an increase in the frequency of somatic biallelic loss-of-function mutations in genes related to homologous recombination DNA repair, compared to early triple-negative breast cancers (7% versus 2%). Finally, metastatic breast cancers showed an increase in mutational burden and clonal diversity compared to early breast cancers. Thus, the genomic landscape of metastatic breast cancer is enriched in clinically relevant genomic alterations and is more complex than that of early breast cancer. The identification of genomic alterations associated with poor outcome will allow earlier and better selection of patients who require the use of treatments that are still in clinical trials. The genetic complexity observed in advanced breast cancer suggests that such treatments should be introduced as early as possible in the disease course.', '7': 'The landscape of cancer-predisposing genes has been extensively investigated in the last 30\\xa0years with various methodologies ranging from candidate gene to genome-wide association studies. However, sequencing data are still poorly exploited in cancer predisposition studies due to the lack of statistical power when comparing millions of variants at once. To overcome these power limitations, we propose a knowledge-based framework founded on the characteristics of known cancer-predisposing variants and genes. Under our framework, we took advantage of a combination of previously generated datasets of sequencing experiments to identify novel breast cancer-predisposing variants, comparing the normal genomes of 673 breast cancer patients of European origin against 27,173 controls matched by ethnicity. We detected several expected variants on known breast cancer-predisposing genes, like BRCA1 and BRCA2, and 11 variants on genes associated with other cancer types, like RET and AKT1.

We compared the frequency of alterations in these potential driver genes in a cohort of metastatic breast cancer patients to a cohort with primary breast cancer, which has not spread. Interestingly, we found that some genes were more frequently mutated in ER+/HER2\u2212 (estrogen receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative) metastatic lesions than in primary breast cancer, suggesting these mutations could play a significant role in the metastasis and evolution of breast cancer.\nGene names and synonyms: KMT2C, HALR, KLEFS2, KMT2C, MLL3\nMolecular profile: KMT2C Loss-of-function\n\n___\nPublication 0.:  title: Genomic landscape of patients with germline RUNX1 variants and familial platelet disorder with myeloid malignancy.\nAbstract: Familial platelet disorder with associated myeloid malignancies (FPDMM) is caused by germline RUNX1 mutations and characterized by thrombocytopenia and increased risk of hematologic malignancies. We recently launched a longitudinal natural history study for patients with FPDMM. Among 27 families with research genomic data by the end of 2021, 26 different germline RUNX1 variants were detected. Besides missense mutations enriched in Runt homology domain and loss-of-function mutations distributed throughout the gene, splice-region mutations and large deletions were detected in 6 and 7 families, respectively. In 25 of 51 (49%) patients without hematologic malignancy, somatic mutations were detected in at least 1 of the clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) genes or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) driver genes. BCOR was the most frequently mutated gene (in 9 patients), and multiple BCOR mutations were identified in 4 patients. Mutations in 6 other CHIP- or AML-driver genes (TET2, DNMT3A, KRAS, LRP1B, IDH1, and KMT2C) were also found in \u22652 patients without hematologic malignancy. Moreover, 3 unrelated patients (1 with myeloid malignancy) carried somatic mutations in NFE2, which regulates erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation. Sequential sequencing data from 19 patients demonstrated dynamic changes of somatic mutations over time, and stable clones were more frequently found in older adult patients. In summary, there are diverse types of germline RUNX1 mutations and high frequency of somatic mutations related to clonal hematopoiesis in patients with FPDMM.

Due to the rarity of these tumors, their molecular profile is not well known. To further investigate the molecular profile and find potential oncogenic drivers, we compared the whole transcriptome and exome of ITACs at different anatomic locations in the head and neck. Twenty-one head and neck adenocarcinomas were used in this study, divided into 10 sinonasal adenocarcinomas (SNT) and 11 extrasinonasal (T) head and neck adenocarcinomas according to anatomic location and histology. Tumor samples along with normal mucosa were microdissected from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples, and RNA and DNA were subjected to whole-transcriptome and -exome shotgun sequencing. Analysis of ITACs at sinonasal locations showed 410 subtype-specific differentially expressed (DE) genes and noncoding transcripts compared with the group of other anatomic locations, with 2909 subtype-specific DE genes. The groups shared 872 genes, with 17 highly different or opposing DE genes. Whole-exome mutation analysis revealed the gene MLL3 (KMT2C) to be exhibiting the most frequent loss-of-function mutations in all adenocarcinomas investigated. The results suggest that the head and neck ITACs investigated were mainly caused by loss-of-function mutations in MLL3 that disabled chromatin methylation and remodeling of all MLL3-targeted enhancers in the tumors. This changed the activity of multiple genes/gene clusters, supporting oncogenicity mostly via pathways of signaling, dedifferentiation, proliferation, migration, and immune and inflammatory deregulation, indicating a truly epigenetic event as the root cause for the heterogenous diversity of these enteric types of cancer. The data of this study form the basis for understanding cell fate determination and cellular homeostasis in the normal respiratory mucosa at different anatomic sites and show the contribution of different mucosal components to the etiology/molecular pathology of ITAC.\nMeSH terms: Humans, Exome, Transcriptome, Biomarkers, Tumor, Adenocarcinoma, Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms\n\n___\nPublication 2.:  title: Genomic Landscape of Patients with Germline <i>RUNX1</i> Variants and Familial Platelet Disorder with Myeloid Malignancy.\nAbstract: Germline <i>RUNX1</i> mutations lead to familial platelet disorder with associated myeloid malignancies (FPDMM), which is characterized by thrombocytopenia and a life-long risk (35-45%) of hematological malignancies. We recently launched a longitudinal natural history study for patients with FPDMM at the NIH Clinical Center. Among 29 families with research genomic data, 28 different germline <i>RUNX1</i> variants were detected. Besides missense mutations enriched in Runt homology domain and loss-of-function mutations distributed throughout the gene, splice-region mutations and large deletions were detected in 6 and 7 families, respectively.

Mutations in 7 other CHIP or AML driver genes ( <i>DNMT3A, TET2, NRAS, SETBP1, SF3B1, KMT2C</i> , and <i>LRP1B</i> ) were also found in more than one non-malignant patient. Moreover, three unrelated patients (one with myeloid malignancy) carried somatic mutations in <i>NFE2</i> , which regulates erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation. Sequential sequencing data from 19 patients demonstrated dynamic changes of somatic mutations over time, and stable clones were more frequently found in elderly patients.

In the present paper, we aim to identify genetic determinants in <i>BRCA</i>-negative families from the South of Tunisia. (2) Methods: Exome Sequencing (ES) was performed on the lymphocyte DNA of patients negative for <i>BRCA</i> mutations from each Tunisian family with a high risk of HBOC. (3) Results: We focus on the canonical genes associated with HBOC and identified missense variants in DNA damage response genes, such as <i>ATM</i>, <i>RAD52</i>, and <i>RAD54</i>; however, no variants in <i>PALB2</i>, <i>Chek2</i>, and <i>TP53</i> genes were found. To identify novel candidate genes, we selected variants harboring a loss of function and identified 17 stop-gain and 11 frameshift variants in genes not commonly known to be predisposed to HBOC. Then, we focus on rare and high-impact genes shared by at least 3 unrelated patients from each family and selected 16 gene variants. Through combined data analysis from MCODE with gene ontology and KEGG pathways, a short list of eight candidate genes (<i>ATM</i>, <i>EP300</i>, <i>LAMA1</i>, <i>LAMC2</i>, <i>TNNI3</i>, <i>MYLK</i>, <i>COL11A2</i>, and <i>LAMB3</i>) was created. The impact of the 24 selected genes on survival was analyzed using the TCGA data resulting in a selection of five candidate genes (<i>EP300</i>, <i>KMT2C</i>, <i>RHPN2</i>, <i>HSPG2</i>, and <i>CCR3)</i> that showed a significant association with survival. (4) Conclusions: We identify novel candidate genes predisposed to HBOC that need to be validated in larger cohorts and investigated by analyzing the co-segregation of selected variants in affected families and the locus-specific loss of heterozygosity to highlight their relevance for HBOC risk.\nMeSH terms: Breast Neoplasms, Exome, Female, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Humans, Ovarian Neoplasms, Exome Sequencing\n\n___\nPublication 4.:  title: Identification of Altered Genes in Gallbladder Cancer as Potential Driver Mutations for Diagnostic and Prognostic Purposes: A Computational Approach.\nAbstract: Prognostic markers for cancer can assist in the evaluation of survival probability of patients and help clinicians to assess the available treatment modalities. Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is a rare tumor that causes 165\u2009087 deaths in the world annually. It is the most common cancer of the biliary tract and has a particularly high incidence in Chile, Japan, and northern India. Currently, there is no accurate diagnosis test or effective molecular markers for GBC identification. Several studies have focused on the discovery of genetic alterations in important genes associated with GBC to propose novel diagnosis pathways and to create prognostic profiles. To achieve this, we performed data-mining of GBC in public repositories, harboring 133 samples of GBC, allowing us to describe relevant somatic mutations in important genes and to propose a genetic alteration atlas for GBC. In our results, we reported the 14 most altered genes in GBC: <i>arid1a, arid2, atm, ctnnb1, erbb2, erbb3, kmt2c, kmt2d, kras, pik3ca, smad4, tert, tp53</i>, and <i>znf521</i> in samples from Japan, the United States, Chile, and China. Missense mutations are common among these genes. The annotations of many mutations revealed their importance in cancer development. The observed annotations mentioned that several mutations found in this repository are probably oncogenic, with a putative loss-of-function. In addition, they are hotspot mutations and are probably linked to poor prognosis in other cancers. We identified another 11 genes, which presented a copy number alteration in gallbladder database samples, which are <i>ccnd1, ccnd3, ccne1, cdk12, cdkn2a, cdkn2b, erbb2, erbb3, kras, mdm2</i>, and <i>myc</i>. The findings reported here can help to detect GBC cancer through the development of systems based on genetic alterations, for example, the development of a mutation panel specifically for GBC diagnosis, as well as the creation of prognostic profiles to accomplish the development of GBC and its prevalence.\nMeSH terms: \n\n___\nPublication 5.:  title: Gene alterations in epigenetic modifiers and JAK-STAT signaling are frequent in breast implant-associated ALCL.\nAbstract: The oncogenic events involved in breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BI-ALCL) remain elusive. To clarify this point, we have characterized the genomic landscape of 34 BI-ALCLs (15 tumor and 19 in situ subtypes) collected from 54 BI-ALCL patients diagnosed through the French Lymphopath network. Whole-exome sequencing (n = 22, with paired tumor/germline DNA) and/or targeted deep sequencing (n = 24) showed recurrent mutations of epigenetic modifiers in 74% of cases, involving notably KMT2C (26%), KMT2D (9%), CHD2 (15%), and CREBBP (15%). KMT2D and KMT2C mutations correlated with a loss of H3K4 mono- and trimethylation by immunohistochemistry. Twenty cases (59%) showed mutations in \u22651 member of the JAK/STAT pathway, including STAT3 (38%), JAK1 (18%), and STAT5B (3%), and in negative regulators, including SOCS3 (6%), SOCS1 (3%), and PTPN1 (3%). These mutations were more frequent in tumor-type samples than in situ samples (P = .038). All BI-ALCLs expressed pSTAT3, regardless of the mutational status of genes in the JAK/STAT pathway. Mutations in the EOMES gene (12%) involved in lymphocyte development, PI3K-AKT/mTOR (6%), and loss-of-function mutations in TP53 (12%) were also identified. Copy-number aberration (CNA) analysis identified recurrent alterations, including gains on chromosomes 2, 9p, 12p, and 21 and losses on 4q, 8p, 15, 16, and 20. Regions of CNA encompassed genes involved in the JAK/STAT pathway and epigenetic regulators. Our results show that the BI-ALCL genomic landscape is characterized by not only JAK/STAT activating mutations but also loss-of-function alterations of epigenetic modifiers.\nMeSH terms: Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Breast Implants, DNA Copy Number Variations, Epigenesis, Genetic, Female, Genome, Human, Humans, Janus Kinases, Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Anaplastic, Middle Aged, Mutation, STAT Transcription Factors, Signal Transduction\n\n___\nPublication 6.:  title: Genomic characterization of metastatic breast cancers.\nAbstract: Metastasis is the main cause of death for patients with breast cancer. Many studies have characterized the genomic landscape of breast cancer during its early stages. However, there is evidence that genomic alterations are acquired during the evolution of cancers from their early to late stages, and that the genomic landscape of early cancers is not representative of that of lethal cancers<sup>1-7</sup>. Here we investigated the landscape of somatic alterations in 617 metastatic breast cancers. Nine driver genes (TP53, ESR1, GATA3, KMT2C, NCOR1, AKT1, NF1, RIC8A and RB1) were more frequently mutated in metastatic breast cancers that expressed hormone receptors (oestrogen and/or progesterone receptors; HR<sup>+</sup>) but did not have high levels of HER2 (HER2<sup>-</sup>; n\u00a0=\u00a0381), when compared to early breast cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas. In addition, 18 amplicons were more frequently observed in HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>-</sup> metastatic breast cancers. These cancers showed an increase in mutational signatures S2, S3, S10, S13 and S17. Among the gene alterations that were enriched in HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>-</sup> metastatic breast cancers, mutations in TP53, RB1 and NF1, together with S10, S13 and S17, were associated with poor outcome. Metastatic triple-negative breast cancers showed an increase in the frequency of somatic biallelic loss-of-function mutations in genes related to homologous recombination DNA repair, compared to early triple-negative breast cancers (7% versus 2%). Finally, metastatic breast cancers showed an increase in mutational burden and clonal diversity compared to early breast cancers. Thus, the genomic landscape of metastatic breast cancer is enriched in clinically relevant genomic alterations and is more complex than that of early breast cancer. The identification of genomic alterations associated with poor outcome will allow earlier and better selection of patients who require the use of treatments that are still in clinical trials. The genetic complexity observed in advanced breast cancer suggests that such treatments should be introduced as early as possible in the disease course.\nMeSH terms: Breast Neoplasms, DNA Mutational Analysis, Disease Progression, Evolution, Molecular, Female, Genome, Human, Genomics, Humans, Male, Mutation, Neoplasm Metastasis, Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms\n\n___\nPublication 7.:  title: A knowledge-based framework for the discovery of cancer-predisposing variants using large-scale sequencing breast cancer data.\nAbstract: The landscape of cancer-predisposing genes has been extensively investigated in the last 30\u00a0years with various methodologies ranging from candidate gene to genome-wide association studies. However, sequencing data are still poorly exploited in cancer predisposition studies due to the lack of statistical power when comparing millions of variants at once. To overcome these power limitations, we propose a knowledge-based framework founded on the characteristics of known cancer-predisposing variants and genes. Under our framework, we took advantage of a combination of previously generated datasets of sequencing experiments to identify novel breast cancer-predisposing variants, comparing the normal genomes of 673 breast cancer patients of European origin against 27,173 controls matched by ethnicity. We detected several expected variants on known breast cancer-predisposing genes, like BRCA1 and BRCA2, and 11 variants on genes associated with other cancer types, like RET and AKT1. Furthermore, we detected 183 variants that overlap with somatic mutations in cancer and 41 variants associated with 38 possible loss-of-function genes, including PIK3CB and KMT2C. Finally, we found a set of 19 variants that are potentially pathogenic, negatively correlate with age at onset, and have never been associated with breast cancer. In this study, we demonstrate the usefulness of a genomic-driven approach nested in a classic case-control study to prioritize cancer-predisposing variants. In addition, we provide a resource containing variants that may affect susceptibility to breast cancer.\nMeSH terms: Age Factors, Alleles, Biomarkers, Tumor, Breast Neoplasms, Case-Control Studies, Epistasis, Genetic, Female, Gene Frequency, Genes, BRCA1, Genes, BRCA2, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Genetic Variation, Genome-Wide Association Study, Genotype, Germ-Line Mutation, Humans, Male, Multifactorial Inheritance, Mutation, Workflow"

Limited effective options are available for un-resectable or metastatic DFSP beyond targeting the oncogenic PDGF pathway with imatinib therapy. We established a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and cell line model (designated MDFSP-S1) of imatinib-resistant DFSP with fibro-sarcomatous transformation. Whole genome sequencing identified high-level amplification at chromosomes 17 and 22, whilst homozygous deep deletion was demonstrated at chromosome 9 (CDKN2A, CDKN2B, MTAP). RNA sequencing followed by Sanger sequencing confirmed the pathognomonic COL1A1-PDGFB t (17;22) rearrangement in the original tumour, PDX and cell line model. Immunohistochemistry profiles of the PDX model were consistent with the patient's tumour sample (CD34\\u2009+\\u2009/MIB1\\u2009+\\u2009/SOX10-\\u2009). Gene set enrichment analysis highlighted top-scoring Hallmark gene sets in several oncogenic signalling pathways, including potentially targetable MTORC1 signalling and angiogenesis pathways. Antiangiogenic agents (sunitinib, regorafenib, pazopanib, axitinib) and the third-generation irreversible epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor osimertinib exhibited modest anti-proliferative activity in the cell line, with IC50 values between 1 and 10\\xa0\u00b5M at 72\\xa0h. No significant activity was observed with imatinib, palbociclib, everolimus, olaparib, gefitinib and erlotinib (IC50 all\\u2009>\\u200910\\xa0\u00b5M). In conclusion, we established MDFSP-S1, a new PDX and cell line model of imatinib-resistant DFSP with fibro-sarcomatous transformation.\", '1': 'We analyzed the oncogenic potential of RET \u0394898-901 mutant and its response to selpercatinib, vandetanib, and cabozantinib in vitro and in a clinical case. A 35-year-old man with a medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) harboring a somatic D898_E901 <i>RET</i> deletion was sequentially treated with vandetanib, selpercatinib, cabozantinib, and fluorouracil (5-FU)-dacarbazine. Functional study of RET \u0394898-901 mutant was performed in HEK-293T, NIH-3T3, and Ba/F3 cells. RET C634R and wild-type cells served as positive and negative controls, respectively. The patient showed primary resistance to vandetanib and secondary resistance to selpercatinib after 12 months. Comprehensive next-generation sequencing of a progressing lesion during selpercatinib showed no additional RET mutation but an acquired complete genetic loss of <i>CDKN2A</i>, <i>CDKN2B,</i> and <i>MTAP</i> genes. Subsequent treatment with cabozantinib and 5-FU-dacarbazine had poor efficacy. In vitro, RET \u0394898-901 showed higher ligand-independent RET autophosphorylation compared with RET C634R and similar proliferation rates in cell models. Subcutaneous injection of \u0394898-901 NIH 3T3 cells in nude mice produced tumors of around 500 mm<sup>3</sup> in 2 weeks, similarly to RET C634R cells. Selpercatinib inhibited cell growth of Ba/F3 RET \u0394898-901 and RET C634R with a similar half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of approximately 3 nM. Vandetanib was five-fold less effective at inhibiting cell growth promoted by RET \u0394898-901 mutant (IC<sub>50</sub>, 564 nM) compared with RET C634R one (IC<sub>50</sub>, 91 nM). Cabozantinib efficiently inhibited Ba/F3 RET C634 proliferation (IC<sub>50</sub>, 25.9 nM), but was scarcely active in Ba/F3 RET 898-901 (IC<sub>50</sub> > 1,350 nM). D898_E901 <i>RET</i> deletion is a gain-of-function mutation and responds to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in MTC. RET \u0394898-901 mutant is sensitive to selpercatinib and vandetanib, and acquired resistance to selpercatinib may develop via RET-independent mechanisms.', '2': 'Lipoblastoma-like tumor (LLT) is a rare adipocytic neoplasm with a predilection for the vulva. Since 2002, <30 cases have been reported, characterizing it as an indolent tumor that may sometimes recur locally. Diagnosis can be challenging due to its rarity and morphologic overlap with other adipocytic tumors. Thus far, there are no specific molecular or immunohistochemical features to aid in the diagnosis of LLT. Recent case reports have described LLT arising at other sites, including the spermatic cord and gluteal region, suggesting wider anatomical distribution. We present a large series of LLT to further characterize its clinicopathologic and molecular features. Twenty-eight cases of LLT were retrieved from departmental and consult archives (including 8 from a prior series). The cohort comprised 28 patients (8 males, 20 females) with a median age of 28 years (range: 1-80 years). There were 17 primary LLT of the vulva. Other anatomical sites included the scrotum (n\\xa0= 3), spermatic cord (n\\xa0= 2), inguinal region (n\\xa0= 2), limbs (n\\xa0= 2), pelvis (n\\xa0= 1), and retroperitoneum (n\\xa0= 1). Median tumor size was 6.0 cm (range: 1.8-30.0 cm). The tumors had a lobulated architecture and were typically composed of adipocytes, lipoblasts, and spindle cells in a myxoid stroma with prominent thin-walled vessels. Using immunohistochemistry, a subset showed loss of Rb expression (12/23 of samples). Follow-up in 15 patients (median: 56 months) revealed 8 patients with local recurrence and 1 patient with metastases to the lung/pleura and breasts. Targeted DNA sequencing revealed a simple genomic profile with limited copy number alterations and low mutational burden. No alterations in RB1 were identified. The metastatic LLT showed concurrent pathogenic PIK3CA and MTOR activating mutations, both in the primary and in the lung/pleural metastasis; the latter also harbored TERT promoter mutation. One tumor had a pathogenic TSC1 mutation, and one tumor showed 2-copy deletion of CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and MTAP. No biologically significant variants were identified in 8 tumors. No gene fusions were identified by RNA sequencing in 4 tumors successfully sequenced. This study expands the clinicopathologic spectrum of LLT, highlighting its wider anatomical distribution and potential for occasional metastasis. Molecularly, we identified activating mutations in the PI3K-MTOR signaling pathway in 2 tumors, which may contribute to exceptional aggressive behavior.', '3': 'Homozygous deletion of <i>MTAP</i> upregulates <i>de novo</i> synthesis of purine (DNSP) and increases the proliferation of neoplastic cells. This increases the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to DNSP inhibitors such as methotrexate, L-alanosine and pemetrexed. 7,301 cases of MBC underwent hybrid-capture based comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP). Tumor mutational burden (TMB) was determined on up to 1.1 Mb of sequenced DNA and microsatellite instability (MSI) was determined on 114 loci. Tumor cell PD-L1 expression was determined by IHC (Dako 22C3). 208 (2.84%) of MBC featured <i>MTAP</i> loss. <i>MTAP</i> loss patients were younger (<i>p</i> = 0.002) and were more frequently ER- (30% vs. 50%; <i>p</i> < 0.0001), triple negative (TNBC) (47% vs. 27%; <i>p</i> < 0.0001) and less frequently HER2+ (2% vs. 8%; <i>p</i> = 0.0001) than <i>MTAP</i> intact MBC. Lobular histology and <i>CDH1</i> mutations were more frequent in <i>MTAP</i> intact (14%) than <i>MTAP</i> loss MBC (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). <i>CDKN2A</i> (100%) and <i>CDKN2B</i> (97%) loss (9p21 co-deletion) were significantly associated with <i>MTAP</i> loss (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). Likely associated with the increased TNBC cases, BRCA1 mutation was also more frequent in <i>MTAP</i> loss MBC (10% vs. 4%; <i>p</i> < 0.0001). As for immune checkpoint inhibitors biomarkers, higher TMB >20 mut/Mb levels in the <i>MTAP</i> intact MBC (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) and higher PD-L1 low expression (1-49% TPS) in the <i>MTAP</i> loss <i>MTAP</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.002) were observed. <i>MTAP</i> loss in MBC has distinct clinical features with genomic alterations (GA) affecting both targeted and immunotherapies. Further efforts are necessary to identify alternative means of targeting PRMT5 and MTA2 in <i>MTAP</i>-ve cancers to benefit from the high-MTA environment of <i>MTAP</i>-deficient cancers.', '4': \"Advanced urothelial carcinoma continues to have a dismal prognosis despite several new therapies in the last 5 years. <i>FGFR2</i> and <i>FGFR3</i> mutations and fusions, PD-L1 expression, tumor mutational burden, and microsatellite instability are established predictive biomarkers in advanced urothelial carcinoma. Novel biomarkers can optimize the sequencing of available treatments and improve outcomes. We describe herein the clinical and pathologic features of patients with an emerging subtype of bladder cancer characterized by deletion of the gene <i>MTAP</i> encoding the enzyme S-Methyl-5'-thioadenosine phosphatase, a potential biomarker of response to pemetrexed. We performed a retrospective analysis of 61 patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma for whom demographics, pathologic specimens, next generation sequencing, and clinical outcomes were available. We compared the frequency of histology variants, upper tract location, pathogenic gene variants, tumor response, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) between patients with tumors harboring <i>MTAP</i> deletion (<i>MTAP</i>-del) and wild type tumors (<i>MTAP</i>-WT). A propensity score matching of 5 covariates (age, gender, presence of variant histology, prior surgery, and prior non-muscle invasive bladder cancer) was calculated to compensate for disparity when comparing survival in these subgroups. Non-supervised clustering analysis of differentially expressed genes between <i>MTAP</i>-del and <i>MTAP</i>-WT urothelial carcinomas was performed. <i>MTAP</i>-del occurred in 19 patients (31%). Tumors with <i>MTAP</i>-del were characterized by higher prevalence of squamous differentiation (47.4 vs 11.9%), bone metastases (52.6 vs 23.5%) and lower frequency of upper urinary tract location (5.2% vs 26.1%). Pathway gene set enrichment analysis showed that among the genes upregulated in the <i>MTAP</i>-del cohort, at least 5 were linked to keratinization (FOXN1, KRT33A/B, KRT84, RPTN) possibly contributing to the higher prevalence of squamous differentiation. Alterations in the PIK3 and MAPK pathways were more frequent when <i>MTAP</i> was deleted. There was a trend to inferior response to chemotherapy among <i>MTAP</i>-del tumors, but no difference in the response to immune checkpoint inhibitors or enfortumab. Median progression free survival after first line therapy (PFS1) was 5.5 months for patients with <i>MTAP</i>-WT and 4.5 months for patients with <i>MTAP</i>-del (HR = 1.30; 95% CI, 0.64-2.63; P = 0.471). There was no difference in the time from metastatic diagnosis to death (P = 0.6346). Median OS from diagnosis of localized or de novo metastatic disease was 16 months (range 1.5-60, IQR 8-26) for patients with MTAP-del and 24.5 months (range 3-156, IQR 16-48) for patients with MTAP-WT (P = 0.0218), suggesting that time to progression to metastatic disease is shorter in MTAP-del patients. Covariates did not impact significantly overall survival on propensity score matching. In conclusion, MTAP -del occurs in approximately 30% of patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma and defines a subgroup of patients with aggressive features, such as squamous differentiation, frequent bone metastases, poor response to chemotherapy, and shorter time to progression to metastatic disease.\", '5': 'When urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) presents or progresses to chemo-refractory metastatic disease, the search for new therapeutic targets is paramount. Targeting protein arginine methyltransferase 5 accumulation in tumors with methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) genomic loss has been proposed as a new anti-tumor strategy. We evaluated the incidence of patients with MTAP loss and correlate to treatment-guiding targets and biomarkers. Two thousand six hundred eighty-three cases of advanced UCB underwent hybrid-capture based comprehensive genomic profiling using the FDA-approved F1CDx assay to evaluate all classes of genomic alterations (GA) among 324 genes. Tumor mutational burden was determined on at least 0.8 Mbp of sequenced DNA and microsatellite instability was determined on at least 95 loci. 650 (24%) of UCB featured MTAP loss mutations (MTAP-). The gene and age distributions were similar in MTAP intact (MTAP+) and MTAP- UCB. MTAP- UCB contained higher GA/tumor frequency than MTAP+ UCB likely reflecting the frequent co-deletions of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A/B. Of potential therapeutic targets, fibroblast growth factor receptor 3, and phosphatase and tensin homolog GA were more frequent in MTAP- UCB. In contrast, biomarkers of immunotherapy response, including higher frequencies of high tumor mutational burden and high programmed death-ligand 1 IHC staining, were observed in the MTAP+ UCB. When compared with MTAP+ UCB, MTAP- UCB differs in genomic signatures including an increase in potentially targetable alterations but a lower frequency of immunotherapy drug biomarkers. Thus, the genomic landscape in MTAP- UCB may play a role in the design of clinical trials incorporating combination treatment strategies when targeting protein arginine methyltransferase 5 in MTAP- tumors.', '6': \"5'-Methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) is a key enzyme in the methionine salvage pathway and has been reported to suppress tumorigenesis. The MTAP gene is located at 9p21, a chromosome region often deleted in breast cancer (BC). However, the clinical and biological significance of MTAP in BC is still unclear. Here, we reported that MTAP was frequently downregulated in 41% (35/85) of primary BCs and 89% (8/9) of BC cell lines. Low expression of MTAP was significantly correlated with a poor survival of BC patients (P=0.0334). Functional studies showed that MTAP was able to suppress both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> tumorigenic ability of BC cells, including migration, invasion, angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastasis in nude mice with orthotopic xenograft tumor of BC. Mechanistically, we found that downregulation of MTAP could increase the polyamine levels by activating ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). By treating the MTAP-repressing BC cells with specific ODC inhibitor Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) or treating the MTAP-overexpressing BC cells with additional putrescine, metastasis-promoting or -suppressing phenotype of these MTAP-manipulated cells was significantly reversed, respectively. Taken together, our data suggested that MTAP has a critical metastasis-suppressive role by tightly regulating ODC activity in BC cells, which may serve as a prominent novel therapeutic target for advanced breast cancer treatment.\", '7': 'Diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) bearing driver mutations of histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27M) are incurable brain tumors with unique epigenomes. Here, we generated a syngeneic H3K27M mouse model to study the amino acid metabolic dependencies of these tumors. H3K27M mutant cells were highly dependent on methionine. Interrogating the methionine cycle dependency through a short-interfering RNA screen identified the enzyme methionine adenosyltransferase 2A (MAT2A) as a critical vulnerability in these tumors. This vulnerability was not mediated through the canonical mechanism of MTAP deletion; instead, DMG cells have lower levels of MAT2A protein, which is mediated by negative feedback induced by the metabolite decarboxylated S-adenosyl methionine. Depletion of residual MAT2A induces global depletion of H3K36me3, a chromatin mark of transcriptional elongation perturbing oncogenic and developmental transcriptional programs. Moreover, methionine-restricted diets extended survival in multiple models of DMG in vivo. Collectively, our results suggest that MAT2A presents an exploitable therapeutic vulnerability in H3K27M gliomas.', '8': \"Genetic alterations in FGF/FGFR pathway are infrequent in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), with rare cases of quadruple wildtype GISTs harboring FGFR1 gene fusions and mutations. Additionally, FGF/FGFR overexpression was shown to promote drug resistance to kinase inhibitors in GISTs. However, FGFR gene fusions have not been directly implicated as a mechanism of drug resistance in GISTs. Herein, we report a patient presenting with a primary small bowel spindle cell GIST and concurrent peritoneal and liver metastases displaying an imatinib-sensitive KIT exon 11 in-frame deletion. After an initial 9-month benefit to imatinib, the patient experienced intraabdominal peritoneal recurrence owing to secondary KIT exon 13 missense mutation and FGFR4 amplification. Despite several additional rounds of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), the patient's disease progressed after 2\\u2009years and presented with multiple peritoneal and liver metastases, including one pericolonic mass harboring secondary KIT exon 18 missense mutation, and a concurrent transverse colonic mass with a FGFR2::TACC2 fusion and AKT2 amplification. All tumors, including primary and recurrent masses, harbored an MGA c.7272\\u2009T\\u2009>\\u2009G (p.Y2424*) nonsense mutation and CDKN2A/CDKN2B/MTAP deletions. The transcolonic mass showed elevated mitotic count (18/10 HPF), as well as significant decrease in CD117 and DOG1 expression, in contrast to all the other resistant nodules that displayed diffuse and strong CD117 and DOG1 immunostaining. The FGFR2::TACC2 fusion resulted from a 742\\u2009kb intrachromosomal inversion at the chr10q26.3 locus, leading to a fusion between exons 1-17 of FGFR2 and exons 7-17 TACC2, which preserves the extracellular and protein tyrosine kinase domains of FGFR2. We present the first report of a multidrug-resistant GIST patient who developed an FGFR2 gene fusion as a secondary genetic event to the selective pressure of various TKIs. This case also highlights the heterogeneous escape mechanisms to targeted therapy across various tumor nodules, spanning from both KIT-dependent and KIT-independent off-target activation pathways.\", '9': 'The overall survival of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains poor and its incidence is rising. Targetable mutations in PDAC are rare, thus novel therapeutic approaches are needed. Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) overexpression is associated with worse survival and inhibition of PRMT5 results in decreased cancer growth across multiple cancers, including PDAC. Emerging evidence also suggests that altered RNA processing is a driver in PDAC tumorigenesis and creates a partial dependency on this process. PRMT5 inhibition induces altered splicing and this vulnerability can be exploited as a novel therapeutic approach. Three possible biological pathways underpinning the action of PRMT5 inhibitors are discussed; c-Myc regulation appears central to its action in the PDAC setting. Whilst homozygous MTAP deletion and symmetrical dimethylation levels are associated with increased sensitivity to PRMT5 inhibition, neither measure robustly predicts its growth inhibitory response. The immunomodulatory effect of PRMT5 inhibitors on the tumour microenvironment will also be discussed, based on emerging evidence that PDAC stroma has a significant bearing on disease behaviour and response to therapy.

We recently launched a longitudinal natural history study for patients with FPDMM. Among 27 families with research genomic data by the end of 2021, 26 different germline RUNX1 variants were detected. Besides missense mutations enriched in Runt homology domain and loss-of-function mutations distributed throughout the gene, splice-region mutations and large deletions were detected in 6 and 7 families, respectively. In 25 of 51 (49%) patients without hematologic malignancy, somatic mutations were detected in at least 1 of the clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) genes or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) driver genes. BCOR was the most frequently mutated gene (in 9 patients), and multiple BCOR mutations were identified in 4 patients. Mutations in 6 other CHIP- or AML-driver genes (TET2, DNMT3A, KRAS, LRP1B, IDH1, and KMT2C) were also found in \u22652 patients without hematologic malignancy. Moreover, 3 unrelated patients (1 with myeloid malignancy) carried somatic mutations in NFE2, which regulates erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation. Sequential sequencing data from 19 patients demonstrated dynamic changes of somatic mutations over time, and stable clones were more frequently found in older adult patients. In summary, there are diverse types of germline RUNX1 mutations and high frequency of somatic mutations related to clonal hematopoiesis in patients with FPDMM. Monitoring changes in somatic mutations and clinical manifestations prospectively may reveal mechanisms for malignant progression and inform clinical management. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT03854318.', '1': 'Adenocarcinomas of the nasal/paranasal sinuses are uncommon, but intestinal-type adenocarcinomas (ITACs) are important. Due to the rarity of these tumors, their molecular profile is not well known. To further investigate the molecular profile and find potential oncogenic drivers, we compared the whole transcriptome and exome of ITACs at different anatomic locations in the head and neck. Twenty-one head and neck adenocarcinomas were used in this study, divided into 10 sinonasal adenocarcinomas (SNT) and 11 extrasinonasal (T) head and neck adenocarcinomas according to anatomic location and histology. Tumor samples along with normal mucosa were microdissected from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples, and RNA and DNA were subjected to whole-transcriptome and -exome shotgun sequencing. Analysis of ITACs at sinonasal locations showed 410 subtype-specific differentially expressed (DE) genes and noncoding transcripts compared with the group of other anatomic locations, with 2909 subtype-specific DE genes. The groups shared 872 genes, with 17 highly different or opposing DE genes. Whole-exome mutation analysis revealed the gene MLL3 (KMT2C) to be exhibiting the most frequent loss-of-function mutations in all adenocarcinomas investigated. The results suggest that the head and neck ITACs investigated were mainly caused by loss-of-function mutations in MLL3 that disabled chromatin methylation and remodeling of all MLL3-targeted enhancers in the tumors. This changed the activity of multiple genes/gene clusters, supporting oncogenicity mostly via pathways of signaling, dedifferentiation, proliferation, migration, and immune and inflammatory deregulation, indicating a truly epigenetic event as the root cause for the heterogenous diversity of these enteric types of cancer. The data of this study form the basis for understanding cell fate determination and cellular homeostasis in the normal respiratory mucosa at different anatomic sites and show the contribution of different mucosal components to the etiology/molecular pathology of ITAC.', '2': 'Germline <i>RUNX1</i> mutations lead to familial platelet disorder with associated myeloid malignancies (FPDMM), which is characterized by thrombocytopenia and a life-long risk (35-45%) of hematological malignancies.

Among 29 families with research genomic data, 28 different germline <i>RUNX1</i> variants were detected. Besides missense mutations enriched in Runt homology domain and loss-of-function mutations distributed throughout the gene, splice-region mutations and large deletions were detected in 6 and 7 families, respectively.

Comprehensive genomic profile of patients with FPDMM with germline <i>RUNX1</i> mutations. Rising clonal hematopoiesis related secondary mutations that may lead to myeloid malignancies.', '3': '(1) Background: Germline variants in <i>BRCA1/BRCA2</i> genes explain about 20% of hereditary breast/ovarian cancer (HBOC) cases. In the present paper, we aim to identify genetic determinants in <i>BRCA</i>-negative families from the South of Tunisia. (2) Methods: Exome Sequencing (ES) was performed on the lymphocyte DNA of patients negative for <i>BRCA</i> mutations from each Tunisian family with a high risk of HBOC. (3) Results: We focus on the canonical genes associated with HBOC and identified missense variants in DNA damage response genes, such as <i>ATM</i>, <i>RAD52</i>, and <i>RAD54</i>; however, no variants in <i>PALB2</i>, <i>Chek2</i>, and <i>TP53</i> genes were found. To identify novel candidate genes, we selected variants harboring a loss of function and identified 17 stop-gain and 11 frameshift variants in genes not commonly known to be predisposed to HBOC. Then, we focus on rare and high-impact genes shared by at least 3 unrelated patients from each family and selected 16 gene variants. Through combined data analysis from MCODE with gene ontology and KEGG pathways, a short list of eight candidate genes (<i>ATM</i>, <i>EP300</i>, <i>LAMA1</i>, <i>LAMC2</i>, <i>TNNI3</i>, <i>MYLK</i>, <i>COL11A2</i>, and <i>LAMB3</i>) was created. The impact of the 24 selected genes on survival was analyzed using the TCGA data resulting in a selection of five candidate genes (<i>EP300</i>, <i>KMT2C</i>, <i>RHPN2</i>, <i>HSPG2</i>, and <i>CCR3)</i> that showed a significant association with survival. (4) Conclusions: We identify novel candidate genes predisposed to HBOC that need to be validated in larger cohorts and investigated by analyzing the co-segregation of selected variants in affected families and the locus-specific loss of heterozygosity to highlight their relevance for HBOC risk.', '4': 'Prognostic markers for cancer can assist in the evaluation of survival probability of patients and help clinicians to assess the available treatment modalities. Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is a rare tumor that causes 165\\u2009087 deaths in the world annually. It is the most common cancer of the biliary tract and has a particularly high incidence in Chile, Japan, and northern India. Currently, there is no accurate diagnosis test or effective molecular markers for GBC identification. Several studies have focused on the discovery of genetic alterations in important genes associated with GBC to propose novel diagnosis pathways and to create prognostic profiles. To achieve this, we performed data-mining of GBC in public repositories, harboring 133 samples of GBC, allowing us to describe relevant somatic mutations in important genes and to propose a genetic alteration atlas for GBC. In our results, we reported the 14 most altered genes in GBC: <i>arid1a, arid2, atm, ctnnb1, erbb2, erbb3, kmt2c, kmt2d, kras, pik3ca, smad4, tert, tp53</i>, and <i>znf521</i> in samples from Japan, the United States, Chile, and China. Missense mutations are common among these genes. The annotations of many mutations revealed their importance in cancer development. The observed annotations mentioned that several mutations found in this repository are probably oncogenic, with a putative loss-of-function. In addition, they are hotspot mutations and are probably linked to poor prognosis in other cancers. We identified another 11 genes, which presented a copy number alteration in gallbladder database samples, which are <i>ccnd1, ccnd3, ccne1, cdk12, cdkn2a, cdkn2b, erbb2, erbb3, kras, mdm2</i>, and <i>myc</i>. The findings reported here can help to detect GBC cancer through the development of systems based on genetic alterations, for example, the development of a mutation panel specifically for GBC diagnosis, as well as the creation of prognostic profiles to accomplish the development of GBC and its prevalence.', '5': 'The oncogenic events involved in breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BI-ALCL) remain elusive. To clarify this point, we have characterized the genomic landscape of 34 BI-ALCLs (15 tumor and 19 in situ subtypes) collected from 54 BI-ALCL patients diagnosed through the French Lymphopath network. Whole-exome sequencing (n = 22, with paired tumor/germline DNA) and/or targeted deep sequencing (n = 24) showed recurrent mutations of epigenetic modifiers in 74% of cases, involving notably KMT2C (26%), KMT2D (9%), CHD2 (15%), and CREBBP (15%). KMT2D and KMT2C mutations correlated with a loss of H3K4 mono- and trimethylation by immunohistochemistry. Twenty cases (59%) showed mutations in \u22651 member of the JAK/STAT pathway, including STAT3 (38%), JAK1 (18%), and STAT5B (3%), and in negative regulators, including SOCS3 (6%), SOCS1 (3%), and PTPN1 (3%). These mutations were more frequent in tumor-type samples than in situ samples (P = .038). All BI-ALCLs expressed pSTAT3, regardless of the mutational status of genes in the JAK/STAT pathway. Mutations in the EOMES gene (12%) involved in lymphocyte development, PI3K-AKT/mTOR (6%), and loss-of-function mutations in TP53 (12%) were also identified. Copy-number aberration (CNA) analysis identified recurrent alterations, including gains on chromosomes 2, 9p, 12p, and 21 and losses on 4q, 8p, 15, 16, and 20. Regions of CNA encompassed genes involved in the JAK/STAT pathway and epigenetic regulators. Our results show that the BI-ALCL genomic landscape is characterized by not only JAK/STAT activating mutations but also loss-of-function alterations of epigenetic modifiers.', '6': 'Metastasis is the main cause of death for patients with breast cancer. Many studies have characterized the genomic landscape of breast cancer during its early stages. However, there is evidence that genomic alterations are acquired during the evolution of cancers from their early to late stages, and that the genomic landscape of early cancers is not representative of that of lethal cancers<sup>1-7</sup>. Here we investigated the landscape of somatic alterations in 617 metastatic breast cancers. Nine driver genes (TP53, ESR1, GATA3, KMT2C, NCOR1, AKT1, NF1, RIC8A and RB1) were more frequently mutated in metastatic breast cancers that expressed hormone receptors (oestrogen and/or progesterone receptors; HR<sup>+</sup>) but did not have high levels of HER2 (HER2<sup>-</sup>; n\\xa0=\\xa0381), when compared to early breast cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas. In addition, 18 amplicons were more frequently observed in HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>-</sup> metastatic breast cancers. These cancers showed an increase in mutational signatures S2, S3, S10, S13 and S17. Among the gene alterations that were enriched in HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>-</sup> metastatic breast cancers, mutations in TP53, RB1 and NF1, together with S10, S13 and S17, were associated with poor outcome. Metastatic triple-negative breast cancers showed an increase in the frequency of somatic biallelic loss-of-function mutations in genes related to homologous recombination DNA repair, compared to early triple-negative breast cancers (7% versus 2%). Finally, metastatic breast cancers showed an increase in mutational burden and clonal diversity compared to early breast cancers. Thus, the genomic landscape of metastatic breast cancer is enriched in clinically relevant genomic alterations and is more complex than that of early breast cancer. The identification of genomic alterations associated with poor outcome will allow earlier and better selection of patients who require the use of treatments that are still in clinical trials. The genetic complexity observed in advanced breast cancer suggests that such treatments should be introduced as early as possible in the disease course.', '7': 'The landscape of cancer-predisposing genes has been extensively investigated in the last 30\\xa0years with various methodologies ranging from candidate gene to genome-wide association studies. However, sequencing data are still poorly exploited in cancer predisposition studies due to the lack of statistical power when comparing millions of variants at once. To overcome these power limitations, we propose a knowledge-based framework founded on the characteristics of known cancer-predisposing variants and genes. Under our framework, we took advantage of a combination of previously generated datasets of sequencing experiments to identify novel breast cancer-predisposing variants, comparing the normal genomes of 673 breast cancer patients of European origin against 27,173 controls matched by ethnicity. We detected several expected variants on known breast cancer-predisposing genes, like BRCA1 and BRCA2, and 11 variants on genes associated with other cancer types, like RET and AKT1. Furthermore, we detected 183 variants that overlap with somatic mutations in cancer and 41 variants associated with 38 possible loss-of-function genes, including PIK3CB and KMT2C. Finally, we found a set of 19 variants that are potentially pathogenic, negatively correlate with age at onset, and have never been associated with breast cancer. In this study, we demonstrate the usefulness of a genomic-driven approach nested in a classic case-control study to prioritize cancer-predisposing variants. In addition, we provide a resource containing variants that may affect susceptibility to breast cancer.'}, 'Publication Date': {'0': 'Not available', '1': '2023-10-31', '2': '2023-01-17', '3': '2022-07-22', '4': '2020-05-25', '5': 'Not available', '6': '2019-05-22', '7': '2017-05-31'}, 'DOI': {'0': '10.1182/bloodadvances.2023011165', '1': '10.1016/j.modpat.2023.100372', '2': '10.1101/2023.01.17.524290', '3': '10.3390/genes13081296', '4': '10.1177/1176935120922154', '5': '10.1182/blood.2019001904', '6': '10.1038/s41586-019-1056-z', '7': '10.1186/s13058-017-0854-1'}, 'Citation Counts': {'0': 0, '1': 0, '2': 0, '3': 1, '4': 10, '5': 61, '6': 290, '7': 1}, 'MeSH terms': {'0': 'Humans, Aged, Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Myeloproliferative Disorders, Hematologic Neoplasms, Genomics, Germ Cells, Blood Platelet Disorders, Blood Coagulation Disorders, Inherited', '1': 'Humans, Exome, Transcriptome, Biomarkers, Tumor, Adenocarcinoma, Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms', '2': '', '3': 'Breast Neoplasms, Exome, Female, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Humans, Ovarian Neoplasms, Exome Sequencing', '4': '', '5': 'Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Breast Implants, DNA Copy Number Variations, Epigenesis, Genetic, Female, Genome, Human, Humans, Janus Kinases, Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Anaplastic, Middle Aged, Mutation, STAT Transcription Factors, Signal Transduction', '6': 'Breast Neoplasms, DNA Mutational Analysis, Disease Progression, Evolution, Molecular, Female, Genome, Human, Genomics, Humans, Male, Mutation, Neoplasm Metastasis, Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms', '7': 'Age Factors, Alleles, Biomarkers, Tumor, Breast Neoplasms, Case-Control Studies, Epistasis, Genetic, Female, Gene Frequency, Genes, BRCA1, Genes, BRCA2, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Genetic Variation, Genome-Wide Association Study, Genotype, Germ-Line Mutation, Humans, Male, Multifactorial Inheritance, Mutation, Workflow'}}}}",

Whole genome sequencing identified high-level amplification at chromosomes 17 and 22, whilst homozygous deep deletion was demonstrated at chromosome 9 (CDKN2A, CDKN2B, MTAP). RNA sequencing followed by Sanger sequencing confirmed the pathognomonic COL1A1-PDGFB t (17;22) rearrangement in the original tumour, PDX and cell line model. Immunohistochemistry profiles of the PDX model were consistent with the patient's tumour sample (CD34\u2009+\u2009/MIB1\u2009+\u2009/SOX10-\u2009). Gene set enrichment analysis highlighted top-scoring Hallmark gene sets in several oncogenic signalling pathways, including potentially targetable MTORC1 signalling and angiogenesis pathways. Antiangiogenic agents (sunitinib, regorafenib, pazopanib, axitinib) and the third-generation irreversible epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor osimertinib exhibited modest anti-proliferative activity in the cell line, with IC50 values between 1 and 10\u00a0\u00b5M at 72\u00a0h. No significant activity was observed with imatinib, palbociclib, everolimus, olaparib, gefitinib and erlotinib (IC50 all\u2009>\u200910\u00a0\u00b5M). In conclusion, we established MDFSP-S1, a new PDX and cell line model of imatinib-resistant DFSP with fibro-sarcomatous transformation.\nMeSH terms: \n title: D898_E901 <i>RET</i> Deletion Is Oncogenic, Responds to Selpercatinib, and Treatment Resistance Can Arise Via RET-Independent Mechanisms.\nAbstract: We analyzed the oncogenic potential of RET \u0394898-901 mutant and its response to selpercatinib, vandetanib, and cabozantinib in vitro and in a clinical case. A 35-year-old man with a medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) harboring a somatic D898_E901 <i>RET</i> deletion was sequentially treated with vandetanib, selpercatinib, cabozantinib, and fluorouracil (5-FU)-dacarbazine. Functional study of RET \u0394898-901 mutant was performed in HEK-293T, NIH-3T3, and Ba/F3 cells. RET C634R and wild-type cells served as positive and negative controls, respectively. The patient showed primary resistance to vandetanib and secondary resistance to selpercatinib after 12 months. Comprehensive next-generation sequencing of a progressing lesion during selpercatinib showed no additional RET mutation but an acquired complete genetic loss of <i>CDKN2A</i>, <i>CDKN2B,</i> and <i>MTAP</i> genes. Subsequent treatment with cabozantinib and 5-FU-dacarbazine had poor efficacy. In vitro, RET \u0394898-901 showed higher ligand-independent RET autophosphorylation compared with RET C634R and similar proliferation rates in cell models. Subcutaneous injection of \u0394898-901 NIH 3T3 cells in nude mice produced tumors of around 500 mm<sup>3</sup> in 2 weeks, similarly to RET C634R cells. Selpercatinib inhibited cell growth of Ba/F3 RET \u0394898-901 and RET C634R with a similar half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of approximately 3 nM. Vandetanib was five-fold less effective at inhibiting cell growth promoted by RET \u0394898-901 mutant (IC<sub>50</sub>, 564 nM) compared with RET C634R one (IC<sub>50</sub>, 91 nM). Cabozantinib efficiently inhibited Ba/F3 RET C634 proliferation (IC<sub>50</sub>, 25.9 nM), but was scarcely active in Ba/F3 RET 898-901 (IC<sub>50</sub> > 1,350 nM). D898_E901 <i>RET</i> deletion is a gain-of-function mutation and responds to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in MTC. RET \u0394898-901 mutant is sensitive to selpercatinib and vandetanib, and acquired resistance to selpercatinib may develop via RET-independent mechanisms.\nMeSH terms: Animals, Mice, Humans, Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret, Mice, Nude, Thyroid Neoplasms, Piperidines, Fluorouracil, Dacarbazine\n title: Expanding the Clinicopathologic and Molecular Spectrum of Lipoblastoma-Like Tumor in a Series of 28 Cases.\nAbstract: Lipoblastoma-like tumor (LLT) is a rare adipocytic neoplasm with a predilection for the vulva. Since 2002, <30 cases have been reported, characterizing it as an indolent tumor that may sometimes recur locally. Diagnosis can be challenging due to its rarity and morphologic overlap with other adipocytic tumors. Thus far, there are no specific molecular or immunohistochemical features to aid in the diagnosis of LLT. Recent case reports have described LLT arising at other sites, including the spermatic cord and gluteal region, suggesting wider anatomical distribution. We present a large series of LLT to further characterize its clinicopathologic and molecular features. Twenty-eight cases of LLT were retrieved from departmental and consult archives (including 8 from a prior series). The cohort comprised 28 patients (8 males, 20 females) with a median age of 28 years (range: 1-80 years). There were 17 primary LLT of the vulva. Other anatomical sites included the scrotum (n\u00a0= 3), spermatic cord (n\u00a0= 2), inguinal region (n\u00a0= 2), limbs (n\u00a0= 2), pelvis (n\u00a0= 1), and retroperitoneum (n\u00a0= 1). Median tumor size was 6.0 cm (range: 1.8-30.0 cm). The tumors had a lobulated architecture and were typically composed of adipocytes, lipoblasts, and spindle cells in a myxoid stroma with prominent thin-walled vessels. Using immunohistochemistry, a subset showed loss of Rb expression (12/23 of samples). Follow-up in 15 patients (median: 56 months) revealed 8 patients with local recurrence and 1 patient with metastases to the lung/pleura and breasts. Targeted DNA sequencing revealed a simple genomic profile with limited copy number alterations and low mutational burden. No alterations in RB1 were identified. The metastatic LLT showed concurrent pathogenic PIK3CA and MTOR activating mutations, both in the primary and in the lung/pleural metastasis; the latter also harbored TERT promoter mutation. One tumor had a pathogenic TSC1 mutation, and one tumor showed 2-copy deletion of CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and MTAP. No biologically significant variants were identified in 8 tumors. No gene fusions were identified by RNA sequencing in 4 tumors successfully sequenced. This study expands the clinicopathologic spectrum of LLT, highlighting its wider anatomical distribution and potential for occasional metastasis. Molecularly, we identified activating mutations in the PI3K-MTOR signaling pathway in 2 tumors, which may contribute to exceptional aggressive behavior.\nMeSH terms: \n title: Genomic landscape of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients with methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (<i>MTAP</i>) loss.\nAbstract: Homozygous deletion of <i>MTAP</i> upregulates <i>de novo</i> synthesis of purine (DNSP) and increases the proliferation of neoplastic cells. This increases the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to DNSP inhibitors such as methotrexate, L-alanosine and pemetrexed. 7,301 cases of MBC underwent hybrid-capture based comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP). Tumor mutational burden (TMB) was determined on up to 1.1 Mb of sequenced DNA and microsatellite instability (MSI) was determined on 114 loci. Tumor cell PD-L1 expression was determined by IHC (Dako 22C3). 208 (2.84%) of MBC featured <i>MTAP</i> loss. <i>MTAP</i> loss patients were younger (<i>p</i> = 0.002) and were more frequently ER- (30% vs. 50%; <i>p</i> < 0.0001), triple negative (TNBC) (47% vs. 27%; <i>p</i> < 0.0001) and less frequently HER2+ (2% vs. 8%; <i>p</i> = 0.0001) than <i>MTAP</i> intact MBC. Lobular histology and <i>CDH1</i> mutations were more frequent in <i>MTAP</i> intact (14%) than <i>MTAP</i> loss MBC (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). <i>CDKN2A</i> (100%) and <i>CDKN2B</i> (97%) loss (9p21 co-deletion) were significantly associated with <i>MTAP</i> loss (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). Likely associated with the increased TNBC cases, BRCA1 mutation was also more frequent in <i>MTAP</i> loss MBC (10% vs. 4%; <i>p</i> < 0.0001). As for immune checkpoint inhibitors biomarkers, higher TMB >20 mut/Mb levels in the <i>MTAP</i> intact MBC (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) and higher PD-L1 low expression (1-49% TPS) in the <i>MTAP</i> loss <i>MTAP</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.002) were observed. <i>MTAP</i> loss in MBC has distinct clinical features with genomic alterations (GA) affecting both targeted and immunotherapies. Further efforts are necessary to identify alternative means of targeting PRMT5 and MTA2 in <i>MTAP</i>-ve cancers to benefit from the high-MTA environment of <i>MTAP</i>-deficient cancers.\nMeSH terms: Humans, B7-H1 Antigen, Homozygote, Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms, Sequence Deletion, Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase, Genomics, Histone Deacetylases, Repressor Proteins, Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases\n title: Clinical features of patients with <i>MTAP</i>-deleted bladder cancer.\nAbstract: Advanced urothelial carcinoma continues to have a dismal prognosis despite several new therapies in the last 5 years. <i>FGFR2</i> and <i>FGFR3</i> mutations and fusions, PD-L1 expression, tumor mutational burden, and microsatellite instability are established predictive biomarkers in advanced urothelial carcinoma. Novel biomarkers can optimize the sequencing of available treatments and improve outcomes. We describe herein the clinical and pathologic features of patients with an emerging subtype of bladder cancer characterized by deletion of the gene <i>MTAP</i> encoding the enzyme S-Methyl-5'-thioadenosine phosphatase, a potential biomarker of response to pemetrexed. We performed a retrospective analysis of 61 patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma for whom demographics, pathologic specimens, next generation sequencing, and clinical outcomes were available. We compared the frequency of histology variants, upper tract location, pathogenic gene variants, tumor response, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) between patients with tumors harboring <i>MTAP</i> deletion (<i>MTAP</i>-del) and wild type tumors (<i>MTAP</i>-WT). A propensity score matching of 5 covariates (age, gender, presence of variant histology, prior surgery, and prior non-muscle invasive bladder cancer) was calculated to compensate for disparity when comparing survival in these subgroups. Non-supervised clustering analysis of differentially expressed genes between <i>MTAP</i>-del and <i>MTAP</i>-WT urothelial carcinomas was performed. <i>MTAP</i>-del occurred in 19 patients (31%). Tumors with <i>MTAP</i>-del were characterized by higher prevalence of squamous differentiation (47.4 vs 11.9%), bone metastases (52.6 vs 23.5%) and lower frequency of upper urinary tract location (5.2% vs 26.1%). Pathway gene set enrichment analysis showed that among the genes upregulated in the <i>MTAP</i>-del cohort, at least 5 were linked to keratinization (FOXN1, KRT33A/B, KRT84, RPTN) possibly contributing to the higher prevalence of squamous differentiation. Alterations in the PIK3 and MAPK pathways were more frequent when <i>MTAP</i> was deleted. There was a trend to inferior response to chemotherapy among <i>MTAP</i>-del tumors, but no difference in the response to immune checkpoint inhibitors or enfortumab. Median progression free survival after first line therapy (PFS1) was 5.5 months for patients with <i>MTAP</i>-WT and 4.5 months for patients with <i>MTAP</i>-del (HR = 1.30; 95% CI, 0.64-2.63; P = 0.471). There was no difference in the time from metastatic diagnosis to death (P = 0.6346). Median OS from diagnosis of localized or de novo metastatic disease was 16 months (range 1.5-60, IQR 8-26) for patients with MTAP-del and 24.5 months (range 3-156, IQR 16-48) for patients with MTAP-WT (P = 0.0218), suggesting that time to progression to metastatic disease is shorter in MTAP-del patients. Covariates did not impact significantly overall survival on propensity score matching. In conclusion, MTAP -del occurs in approximately 30% of patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma and defines a subgroup of patients with aggressive features, such as squamous differentiation, frequent bone metastases, poor response to chemotherapy, and shorter time to progression to metastatic disease.\nMeSH terms: \n title: Novel synthetic lethality drug target in urothelial bladder cancer based on MTAP genomic loss.\nAbstract: When urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) presents or progresses to chemo-refractory metastatic disease, the search for new therapeutic targets is paramount. Targeting protein arginine methyltransferase 5 accumulation in tumors with methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) genomic loss has been proposed as a new anti-tumor strategy. We evaluated the incidence of patients with MTAP loss and correlate to treatment-guiding targets and biomarkers. Two thousand six hundred eighty-three cases of advanced UCB underwent hybrid-capture based comprehensive genomic profiling using the FDA-approved F1CDx assay to evaluate all classes of genomic alterations (GA) among 324 genes. Tumor mutational burden was determined on at least 0.8 Mbp of sequenced DNA and microsatellite instability was determined on at least 95 loci. 650 (24%) of UCB featured MTAP loss mutations (MTAP-). The gene and age distributions were similar in MTAP intact (MTAP+) and MTAP- UCB. MTAP- UCB contained higher GA/tumor frequency than MTAP+ UCB likely reflecting the frequent co-deletions of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A/B. Of potential therapeutic targets, fibroblast growth factor receptor 3, and phosphatase and tensin homolog GA were more frequent in MTAP- UCB. In contrast, biomarkers of immunotherapy response, including higher frequencies of high tumor mutational burden and high programmed death-ligand 1 IHC staining, were observed in the MTAP+ UCB. When compared with MTAP+ UCB, MTAP- UCB differs in genomic signatures including an increase in potentially targetable alterations but a lower frequency of immunotherapy drug biomarkers. Thus, the genomic landscape in MTAP- UCB may play a role in the design of clinical trials incorporating combination treatment strategies when targeting protein arginine methyltransferase 5 in MTAP- tumors.\nMeSH terms: Humans, Carcinoma, Transitional Cell, Urinary Bladder Neoplasms, Synthetic Lethal Mutations, Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases, Genomics\n title: Downregulation of MTAP promotes Tumor Growth and Metastasis by regulating ODC Activity in Breast Cancer.\nAbstract: 5'-Methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) is a key enzyme in the methionine salvage pathway and has been reported to suppress tumorigenesis. The MTAP gene is located at 9p21, a chromosome region often deleted in breast cancer (BC). However, the clinical and biological significance of MTAP in BC is still unclear. Here, we reported that MTAP was frequently downregulated in 41% (35/85) of primary BCs and 89% (8/9) of BC cell lines. Low expression of MTAP was significantly correlated with a poor survival of BC patients (P=0.0334). Functional studies showed that MTAP was able to suppress both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> tumorigenic ability of BC cells, including migration, invasion, angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastasis in nude mice with orthotopic xenograft tumor of BC. Mechanistically, we found that downregulation of MTAP could increase the polyamine levels by activating ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). By treating the MTAP-repressing BC cells with specific ODC inhibitor Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) or treating the MTAP-overexpressing BC cells with additional putrescine, metastasis-promoting or -suppressing phenotype of these MTAP-manipulated cells was significantly reversed, respectively. Taken together, our data suggested that MTAP has a critical metastasis-suppressive role by tightly regulating ODC activity in BC cells, which may serve as a prominent novel therapeutic target for advanced breast cancer treatment.\nMeSH terms: Animals, Breast Neoplasms, Down-Regulation, Female, Heterografts, Humans, Mice, Mice, Nude, Ornithine Decarboxylase, Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase\n title: Loss of MAT2A compromises methionine metabolism and represents a vulnerability in H3K27M mutant glioma by modulating the epigenome.\nAbstract: Diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) bearing driver mutations of histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27M) are incurable brain tumors with unique epigenomes. Here, we generated a syngeneic H3K27M mouse model to study the amino acid metabolic dependencies of these tumors. H3K27M mutant cells were highly dependent on methionine. Interrogating the methionine cycle dependency through a short-interfering RNA screen identified the enzyme methionine adenosyltransferase 2A (MAT2A) as a critical vulnerability in these tumors. This vulnerability was not mediated through the canonical mechanism of MTAP deletion; instead, DMG cells have lower levels of MAT2A protein, which is mediated by negative feedback induced by the metabolite decarboxylated S-adenosyl methionine. Depletion of residual MAT2A induces global depletion of H3K36me3, a chromatin mark of transcriptional elongation perturbing oncogenic and developmental transcriptional programs. Moreover, methionine-restricted diets extended survival in multiple models of DMG in vivo. Collectively, our results suggest that MAT2A presents an exploitable therapeutic vulnerability in H3K27M gliomas.\nMeSH terms: Animals, Brain Neoplasms, Epigenome, Glioma, Histones, Methionine, Methionine Adenosyltransferase, Mice\n title: FGFR2::TACC2 fusion as a novel KIT-independent mechanism of targeted therapy failure in a multidrug-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumor.\nAbstract: Genetic alterations in FGF/FGFR pathway are infrequent in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), with rare cases of quadruple wildtype GISTs harboring FGFR1 gene fusions and mutations. Additionally, FGF/FGFR overexpression was shown to promote drug resistance to kinase inhibitors in GISTs. However, FGFR gene fusions have not been directly implicated as a mechanism of drug resistance in GISTs. Herein, we report a patient presenting with a primary small bowel spindle cell GIST and concurrent peritoneal and liver metastases displaying an imatinib-sensitive KIT exon 11 in-frame deletion. After an initial 9-month benefit to imatinib, the patient experienced intraabdominal peritoneal recurrence owing to secondary KIT exon 13 missense mutation and FGFR4 amplification. Despite several additional rounds of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), the patient's disease progressed after 2\u2009years and presented with multiple peritoneal and liver metastases, including one pericolonic mass harboring secondary KIT exon 18 missense mutation, and a concurrent transverse colonic mass with a FGFR2::TACC2 fusion and AKT2 amplification. All tumors, including primary and recurrent masses, harbored an MGA c.7272\u2009T\u2009>\u2009G (p.Y2424*) nonsense mutation and CDKN2A/CDKN2B/MTAP deletions. The transcolonic mass showed elevated mitotic count (18/10 HPF), as well as significant decrease in CD117 and DOG1 expression, in contrast to all the other resistant nodules that displayed diffuse and strong CD117 and DOG1 immunostaining. The FGFR2::TACC2 fusion resulted from a 742\u2009kb intrachromosomal inversion at the chr10q26.3 locus, leading to a fusion between exons 1-17 of FGFR2 and exons 7-17 TACC2, which preserves the extracellular and protein tyrosine kinase domains of FGFR2. We present the first report of a multidrug-resistant GIST patient who developed an FGFR2 gene fusion as a secondary genetic event to the selective pressure of various TKIs. This case also highlights the heterogeneous escape mechanisms to targeted therapy across various tumor nodules, spanning from both KIT-dependent and KIT-independent off-target activation pathways.\nMeSH terms: Antineoplastic Agents, Carrier Proteins, Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors, Gene Fusion, Humans, Imatinib Mesylate, Liver Neoplasms, Mutation, Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit, Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 2, Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha, Tumor Suppressor Proteins\n title: PRMT5: An Emerging Target for Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma.\nAbstract: The overall survival of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains poor and its incidence is rising. Targetable mutations in PDAC are rare, thus novel therapeutic approaches are needed. Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) overexpression is associated with worse survival and inhibition of PRMT5 results in decreased cancer growth across multiple cancers, including PDAC. Emerging evidence also suggests that altered RNA processing is a driver in PDAC tumorigenesis and creates a partial dependency on this process. PRMT5 inhibition induces altered splicing and this vulnerability can be exploited as a novel therapeutic approach. Three possible biological pathways underpinning the action of PRMT5 inhibitors are discussed; c-Myc regulation appears central to its action in the PDAC setting. Whilst homozygous MTAP deletion and symmetrical dimethylation levels are associated with increased sensitivity to PRMT5 inhibition, neither measure robustly predicts its growth inhibitory response. The immunomodulatory effect of PRMT5 inhibitors on the tumour microenvironment will also be discussed, based on emerging evidence that PDAC stroma has a significant bearing on disease behaviour and response to therapy. Lastly, with the above caveats in mind, current knowledge gaps and the implications and rationales for PRMT5 inhibitor development in PDAC will be explored.\nMeSH terms: "

Interestingly, we found that some genes were more frequently mutated in ER+/HER2\u2212 (estrogen receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative) metastatic lesions than in primary breast cancer, suggesting these mutations could play a significant role in the metastasis and evolution of breast cancer.\nGene names and synonyms: MTAP, BDMF, DMSFH, DMSMFH, HEL-249, LGMBF, MSAP, MTAP, c86fus\nMolecular profile: MTAP Deletion\n title: Multi-omic profiling and real time ex vivo modelling of imatinib-resistant dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans with fibrosarcomatous transformation.\nAbstract: Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a rare and indolent cutaneous sarcoma, with the risk of aggressive fibro-sarcomatous transformation. Limited effective options are available for un-resectable or metastatic DFSP beyond targeting the oncogenic PDGF pathway with imatinib therapy. We established a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and cell line model (designated MDFSP-S1) of imatinib-resistant DFSP with fibro-sarcomatous transformation. Whole genome sequencing identified high-level amplification at chromosomes 17 and 22, whilst homozygous deep deletion was demonstrated at chromosome 9 (CDKN2A, CDKN2B, MTAP). RNA sequencing followed by Sanger sequencing confirmed the pathognomonic COL1A1-PDGFB t (17;22) rearrangement in the original tumour, PDX and cell line model. Immunohistochemistry profiles of the PDX model were consistent with the patient's tumour sample (CD34\u2009+\u2009/MIB1\u2009+\u2009/SOX10-\u2009). Gene set enrichment analysis highlighted top-scoring Hallmark gene sets in several oncogenic signalling pathways, including potentially targetable MTORC1 signalling and angiogenesis pathways. Antiangiogenic agents (sunitinib, regorafenib, pazopanib, axitinib) and the third-generation irreversible epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor osimertinib exhibited modest anti-proliferative activity in the cell line, with IC50 values between 1 and 10\u00a0\u00b5M at 72\u00a0h.

A 35-year-old man with a medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) harboring a somatic D898_E901 <i>RET</i> deletion was sequentially treated with vandetanib, selpercatinib, cabozantinib, and fluorouracil (5-FU)-dacarbazine. Functional study of RET \u0394898-901 mutant was performed in HEK-293T, NIH-3T3, and Ba/F3 cells. RET C634R and wild-type cells served as positive and negative controls, respectively. The patient showed primary resistance to vandetanib and secondary resistance to selpercatinib after 12 months. Comprehensive next-generation sequencing of a progressing lesion during selpercatinib showed no additional RET mutation but an acquired complete genetic loss of <i>CDKN2A</i>, <i>CDKN2B,</i> and <i>MTAP</i> genes. Subsequent treatment with cabozantinib and 5-FU-dacarbazine had poor efficacy. In vitro, RET \u0394898-901 showed higher ligand-independent RET autophosphorylation compared with RET C634R and similar proliferation rates in cell models. Subcutaneous injection of \u0394898-901 NIH 3T3 cells in nude mice produced tumors of around 500 mm<sup>3</sup> in 2 weeks, similarly to RET C634R cells. Selpercatinib inhibited cell growth of Ba/F3 RET \u0394898-901 and RET C634R with a similar half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of approximately 3 nM. Vandetanib was five-fold less effective at inhibiting cell growth promoted by RET \u0394898-901 mutant (IC<sub>50</sub>, 564 nM) compared with RET C634R one (IC<sub>50</sub>, 91 nM). Cabozantinib efficiently inhibited Ba/F3 RET C634 proliferation (IC<sub>50</sub>, 25.9 nM), but was scarcely active in Ba/F3 RET 898-901 (IC<sub>50</sub> > 1,350 nM). D898_E901 <i>RET</i> deletion is a gain-of-function mutation and responds to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in MTC.

Since 2002, <30 cases have been reported, characterizing it as an indolent tumor that may sometimes recur locally. Diagnosis can be challenging due to its rarity and morphologic overlap with other adipocytic tumors. Thus far, there are no specific molecular or immunohistochemical features to aid in the diagnosis of LLT. Recent case reports have described LLT arising at other sites, including the spermatic cord and gluteal region, suggesting wider anatomical distribution. We present a large series of LLT to further characterize its clinicopathologic and molecular features. Twenty-eight cases of LLT were retrieved from departmental and consult archives (including 8 from a prior series). The cohort comprised 28 patients (8 males, 20 females) with a median age of 28 years (range: 1-80 years). There were 17 primary LLT of the vulva. Other anatomical sites included the scrotum (n\u00a0= 3), spermatic cord (n\u00a0= 2), inguinal region (n\u00a0= 2), limbs (n\u00a0= 2), pelvis (n\u00a0= 1), and retroperitoneum (n\u00a0= 1). Median tumor size was 6.0 cm (range: 1.8-30.0 cm). The tumors had a lobulated architecture and were typically composed of adipocytes, lipoblasts, and spindle cells in a myxoid stroma with prominent thin-walled vessels.

Follow-up in 15 patients (median: 56 months) revealed 8 patients with local recurrence and 1 patient with metastases to the lung/pleura and breasts. Targeted DNA sequencing revealed a simple genomic profile with limited copy number alterations and low mutational burden. No alterations in RB1 were identified. The metastatic LLT showed concurrent pathogenic PIK3CA and MTOR activating mutations, both in the primary and in the lung/pleural metastasis; the latter also harbored TERT promoter mutation. One tumor had a pathogenic TSC1 mutation, and one tumor showed 2-copy deletion of CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and MTAP. No biologically significant variants were identified in 8 tumors. No gene fusions were identified by RNA sequencing in 4 tumors successfully sequenced. This study expands the clinicopathologic spectrum of LLT, highlighting its wider anatomical distribution and potential for occasional metastasis. Molecularly, we identified activating mutations in the PI3K-MTOR signaling pathway in 2 tumors, which may contribute to exceptional aggressive behavior.\nMeSH terms: \n title: Genomic landscape of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients with methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (<i>MTAP</i>) loss.\nAbstract: Homozygous deletion of <i>MTAP</i> upregulates <i>de novo</i> synthesis of purine (DNSP) and increases the proliferation of neoplastic cells. This increases the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to DNSP inhibitors such as methotrexate, L-alanosine and pemetrexed. 7,301 cases of MBC underwent hybrid-capture based comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP). Tumor mutational burden (TMB) was determined on up to 1.1 Mb of sequenced DNA and microsatellite instability (MSI) was determined on 114 loci. Tumor cell PD-L1 expression was determined by IHC (Dako 22C3). 208 (2.84%) of MBC featured <i>MTAP</i> loss. <i>MTAP</i> loss patients were younger (<i>p</i> = 0.002) and were more frequently ER- (30% vs. 50%; <i>p</i> < 0.0001), triple negative (TNBC) (47% vs. 27%; <i>p</i> < 0.0001) and less frequently HER2+ (2% vs. 8%; <i>p</i> = 0.0001) than <i>MTAP</i> intact MBC. Lobular histology and <i>CDH1</i> mutations were more frequent in <i>MTAP</i> intact (14%) than <i>MTAP</i> loss MBC (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). <i>CDKN2A</i> (100%) and <i>CDKN2B</i> (97%) loss (9p21 co-deletion) were significantly associated with <i>MTAP</i> loss (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). Likely associated with the increased TNBC cases, BRCA1 mutation was also more frequent in <i>MTAP</i> loss MBC (10% vs. 4%; <i>p</i> < 0.0001). As for immune checkpoint inhibitors biomarkers, higher TMB >20 mut/Mb levels in the <i>MTAP</i> intact MBC (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) and higher PD-L1 low expression (1-49% TPS) in the <i>MTAP</i> loss <i>MTAP</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.002) were observed. <i>MTAP</i> loss in MBC has distinct clinical features with genomic alterations (GA) affecting both targeted and immunotherapies. Further efforts are necessary to identify alternative means of targeting PRMT5 and MTA2 in <i>MTAP</i>-ve cancers to benefit from the high-MTA environment of <i>MTAP</i>-deficient cancers.\nMeSH terms: Humans, B7-H1 Antigen, Homozygote, Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms, Sequence Deletion, Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase, Genomics, Histone Deacetylases, Repressor Proteins, Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases\n title: Clinical features of patients with <i>MTAP</i>-deleted bladder cancer.\nAbstract: Advanced urothelial carcinoma continues to have a dismal prognosis despite several new therapies in the last 5 years. <i>FGFR2</i> and <i>FGFR3</i> mutations and fusions, PD-L1 expression, tumor mutational burden, and microsatellite instability are established predictive biomarkers in advanced urothelial carcinoma. Novel biomarkers can optimize the sequencing of available treatments and improve outcomes. We describe herein the clinical and pathologic features of patients with an emerging subtype of bladder cancer characterized by deletion of the gene <i>MTAP</i> encoding the enzyme S-Methyl-5'-thioadenosine phosphatase, a potential biomarker of response to pemetrexed. We performed a retrospective analysis of 61 patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma for whom demographics, pathologic specimens, next generation sequencing, and clinical outcomes were available. We compared the frequency of histology variants, upper tract location, pathogenic gene variants, tumor response, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) between patients with tumors harboring <i>MTAP</i> deletion (<i>MTAP</i>-del) and wild type tumors (<i>MTAP</i>-WT). A propensity score matching of 5 covariates (age, gender, presence of variant histology, prior surgery, and prior non-muscle invasive bladder cancer) was calculated to compensate for disparity when comparing survival in these subgroups. Non-supervised clustering analysis of differentially expressed genes between <i>MTAP</i>-del and <i>MTAP</i>-WT urothelial carcinomas was performed. <i>MTAP</i>-del occurred in 19 patients (31%). Tumors with <i>MTAP</i>-del were characterized by higher prevalence of squamous differentiation (47.4 vs 11.9%), bone metastases (52.6 vs 23.5%) and lower frequency of upper urinary tract location (5.2% vs 26.1%). Pathway gene set enrichment analysis showed that among the genes upregulated in the <i>MTAP</i>-del cohort, at least 5 were linked to keratinization (FOXN1, KRT33A/B, KRT84, RPTN) possibly contributing to the higher prevalence of squamous differentiation. Alterations in the PIK3 and MAPK pathways were more frequent when <i>MTAP</i> was deleted. There was a trend to inferior response to chemotherapy among <i>MTAP</i>-del tumors, but no difference in the response to immune checkpoint inhibitors or enfortumab. Median progression free survival after first line therapy (PFS1) was 5.5 months for patients with <i>MTAP</i>-WT and 4.5 months for patients with <i>MTAP</i>-del (HR = 1.30; 95% CI, 0.64-2.63; P = 0.471). There was no difference in the time from metastatic diagnosis to death (P = 0.6346). Median OS from diagnosis of localized or de novo metastatic disease was 16 months (range 1.5-60, IQR 8-26) for patients with MTAP-del and 24.5 months (range 3-156, IQR 16-48) for patients with MTAP-WT (P = 0.0218), suggesting that time to progression to metastatic disease is shorter in MTAP-del patients. Covariates did not impact significantly overall survival on propensity score matching. In conclusion, MTAP -del occurs in approximately 30% of patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma and defines a subgroup of patients with aggressive features, such as squamous differentiation, frequent bone metastases, poor response to chemotherapy, and shorter time to progression to metastatic disease.\nMeSH terms: \n title: Novel synthetic lethality drug target in urothelial bladder cancer based on MTAP genomic loss.\nAbstract: When urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) presents or progresses to chemo-refractory metastatic disease, the search for new therapeutic targets is paramount. Targeting protein arginine methyltransferase 5 accumulation in tumors with methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) genomic loss has been proposed as a new anti-tumor strategy. We evaluated the incidence of patients with MTAP loss and correlate to treatment-guiding targets and biomarkers. Two thousand six hundred eighty-three cases of advanced UCB underwent hybrid-capture based comprehensive genomic profiling using the FDA-approved F1CDx assay to evaluate all classes of genomic alterations (GA) among 324 genes. Tumor mutational burden was determined on at least 0.8 Mbp of sequenced DNA and microsatellite instability was determined on at least 95 loci. 650 (24%) of UCB featured MTAP loss mutations (MTAP-). The gene and age distributions were similar in MTAP intact (MTAP+) and MTAP- UCB. MTAP- UCB contained higher GA/tumor frequency than MTAP+ UCB likely reflecting the frequent co-deletions of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A/B. Of potential therapeutic targets, fibroblast growth factor receptor 3, and phosphatase and tensin homolog GA were more frequent in MTAP- UCB. In contrast, biomarkers of immunotherapy response, including higher frequencies of high tumor mutational burden and high programmed death-ligand 1 IHC staining, were observed in the MTAP+ UCB. When compared with MTAP+ UCB, MTAP- UCB differs in genomic signatures including an increase in potentially targetable alterations but a lower frequency of immunotherapy drug biomarkers. Thus, the genomic landscape in MTAP- UCB may play a role in the design of clinical trials incorporating combination treatment strategies when targeting protein arginine methyltransferase 5 in MTAP- tumors.\nMeSH terms: Humans, Carcinoma, Transitional Cell, Urinary Bladder Neoplasms, Synthetic Lethal Mutations, Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases, Genomics\n title: Downregulation of MTAP promotes Tumor Growth and Metastasis by regulating ODC Activity in Breast Cancer.\nAbstract: 5'-Methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) is a key enzyme in the methionine salvage pathway and has been reported to suppress tumorigenesis. The MTAP gene is located at 9p21, a chromosome region often deleted in breast cancer (BC). However, the clinical and biological significance of MTAP in BC is still unclear. Here, we reported that MTAP was frequently downregulated in 41% (35/85) of primary BCs and 89% (8/9) of BC cell lines. Low expression of MTAP was significantly correlated with a poor survival of BC patients (P=0.0334). Functional studies showed that MTAP was able to suppress both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> tumorigenic ability of BC cells, including migration, invasion, angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastasis in nude mice with orthotopic xenograft tumor of BC. Mechanistically, we found that downregulation of MTAP could increase the polyamine levels by activating ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). By treating the MTAP-repressing BC cells with specific ODC inhibitor Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) or treating the MTAP-overexpressing BC cells with additional putrescine, metastasis-promoting or -suppressing phenotype of these MTAP-manipulated cells was significantly reversed, respectively. Taken together, our data suggested that MTAP has a critical metastasis-suppressive role by tightly regulating ODC activity in BC cells, which may serve as a prominent novel therapeutic target for advanced breast cancer treatment.\nMeSH terms: Animals, Breast Neoplasms, Down-Regulation, Female, Heterografts, Humans, Mice, Mice, Nude, Ornithine Decarboxylase, Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase\n title: Loss of MAT2A compromises methionine metabolism and represents a vulnerability in H3K27M mutant glioma by modulating the epigenome.\nAbstract: Diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) bearing driver mutations of histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27M) are incurable brain tumors with unique epigenomes. Here, we generated a syngeneic H3K27M mouse model to study the amino acid metabolic dependencies of these tumors. H3K27M mutant cells were highly dependent on methionine. Interrogating the methionine cycle dependency through a short-interfering RNA screen identified the enzyme methionine adenosyltransferase 2A (MAT2A) as a critical vulnerability in these tumors. This vulnerability was not mediated through the canonical mechanism of MTAP deletion; instead, DMG cells have lower levels of MAT2A protein, which is mediated by negative feedback induced by the metabolite decarboxylated S-adenosyl methionine. Depletion of residual MAT2A induces global depletion of H3K36me3, a chromatin mark of transcriptional elongation perturbing oncogenic and developmental transcriptional programs. Moreover, methionine-restricted diets extended survival in multiple models of DMG in vivo. Collectively, our results suggest that MAT2A presents an exploitable therapeutic vulnerability in H3K27M gliomas.\nMeSH terms: Animals, Brain Neoplasms, Epigenome, Glioma, Histones, Methionine, Methionine Adenosyltransferase, Mice\n title: FGFR2::TACC2 fusion as a novel KIT-independent mechanism of targeted therapy failure in a multidrug-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumor.\nAbstract: Genetic alterations in FGF/FGFR pathway are infrequent in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), with rare cases of quadruple wildtype GISTs harboring FGFR1 gene fusions and mutations. Additionally, FGF/FGFR overexpression was shown to promote drug resistance to kinase inhibitors in GISTs. However, FGFR gene fusions have not been directly implicated as a mechanism of drug resistance in GISTs. Herein, we report a patient presenting with a primary small bowel spindle cell GIST and concurrent peritoneal and liver metastases displaying an imatinib-sensitive KIT exon 11 in-frame deletion. After an initial 9-month benefit to imatinib, the patient experienced intraabdominal peritoneal recurrence owing to secondary KIT exon 13 missense mutation and FGFR4 amplification. Despite several additional rounds of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), the patient's disease progressed after 2\u2009years and presented with multiple peritoneal and liver metastases, including one pericolonic mass harboring secondary KIT exon 18 missense mutation, and a concurrent transverse colonic mass with a FGFR2::TACC2 fusion and AKT2 amplification. All tumors, including primary and recurrent masses, harbored an MGA c.7272\u2009T\u2009>\u2009G (p.Y2424*) nonsense mutation and CDKN2A/CDKN2B/MTAP deletions. The transcolonic mass showed elevated mitotic count (18/10 HPF), as well as significant decrease in CD117 and DOG1 expression, in contrast to all the other resistant nodules that displayed diffuse and strong CD117 and DOG1 immunostaining. The FGFR2::TACC2 fusion resulted from a 742\u2009kb intrachromosomal inversion at the chr10q26.3 locus, leading to a fusion between exons 1-17 of FGFR2 and exons 7-17 TACC2, which preserves the extracellular and protein tyrosine kinase domains of FGFR2. We present the first report of a multidrug-resistant GIST patient who developed an FGFR2 gene fusion as a secondary genetic event to the selective pressure of various TKIs. This case also highlights the heterogeneous escape mechanisms to targeted therapy across various tumor nodules, spanning from both KIT-dependent and KIT-independent off-target activation pathways.\nMeSH terms: Antineoplastic Agents, Carrier Proteins, Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors, Gene Fusion, Humans, Imatinib Mesylate, Liver Neoplasms, Mutation, Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit, Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 2, Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha, Tumor Suppressor Proteins\n title: PRMT5: An Emerging Target for Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma.\nAbstract: The overall survival of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains poor and its incidence is rising. Targetable mutations in PDAC are rare, thus novel therapeutic approaches are needed. Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) overexpression is associated with worse survival and inhibition of PRMT5 results in decreased cancer growth across multiple cancers, including PDAC. Emerging evidence also suggests that altered RNA processing is a driver in PDAC tumorigenesis and creates a partial dependency on this process. PRMT5 inhibition induces altered splicing and this vulnerability can be exploited as a novel therapeutic approach. Three possible biological pathways underpinning the action of PRMT5 inhibitors are discussed; c-Myc regulation appears central to its action in the PDAC setting. Whilst homozygous MTAP deletion and symmetrical dimethylation levels are associated with increased sensitivity to PRMT5 inhibition, neither measure robustly predicts its growth inhibitory response. The immunomodulatory effect of PRMT5 inhibitors on the tumour microenvironment will also be discussed, based on emerging evidence that PDAC stroma has a significant bearing on disease behaviour and response to therapy. Lastly, with the above caveats in mind, current knowledge gaps and the implications and rationales for PRMT5 inhibitor development in PDAC will be explored.\nMeSH terms: ",

Limited effective options are available for un-resectable or metastatic DFSP beyond targeting the oncogenic PDGF pathway with imatinib therapy. We established a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and cell line model (designated MDFSP-S1) of imatinib-resistant DFSP with fibro-sarcomatous transformation. Whole genome sequencing identified high-level amplification at chromosomes 17 and 22, whilst homozygous deep deletion was demonstrated at chromosome 9 (CDKN2A, CDKN2B, MTAP). RNA sequencing followed by Sanger sequencing confirmed the pathognomonic COL1A1-PDGFB t (17;22) rearrangement in the original tumour, PDX and cell line model. Immunohistochemistry profiles of the PDX model were consistent with the patient's tumour sample (CD34\\u2009+\\u2009/MIB1\\u2009+\\u2009/SOX10-\\u2009). Gene set enrichment analysis highlighted top-scoring Hallmark gene sets in several oncogenic signalling pathways, including potentially targetable MTORC1 signalling and angiogenesis pathways. Antiangiogenic agents (sunitinib, regorafenib, pazopanib, axitinib) and the third-generation irreversible epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor osimertinib exhibited modest anti-proliferative activity in the cell line, with IC50 values between 1 and 10\\xa0\u00b5M at 72\\xa0h. No significant activity was observed with imatinib, palbociclib, everolimus, olaparib, gefitinib and erlotinib (IC50 all\\u2009>\\u200910\\xa0\u00b5M). In conclusion, we established MDFSP-S1, a new PDX and cell line model of imatinib-resistant DFSP with fibro-sarcomatous transformation.\", '1': 'We analyzed the oncogenic potential of RET \u0394898-901 mutant and its response to selpercatinib, vandetanib, and cabozantinib in vitro and in a clinical case. A 35-year-old man with a medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) harboring a somatic D898_E901 <i>RET</i> deletion was sequentially treated with vandetanib, selpercatinib, cabozantinib, and fluorouracil (5-FU)-dacarbazine. Functional study of RET \u0394898-901 mutant was performed in HEK-293T, NIH-3T3, and Ba/F3 cells. RET C634R and wild-type cells served as positive and negative controls, respectively. The patient showed primary resistance to vandetanib and secondary resistance to selpercatinib after 12 months. Comprehensive next-generation sequencing of a progressing lesion during selpercatinib showed no additional RET mutation but an acquired complete genetic loss of <i>CDKN2A</i>, <i>CDKN2B,</i> and <i>MTAP</i> genes. Subsequent treatment with cabozantinib and 5-FU-dacarbazine had poor efficacy. In vitro, RET \u0394898-901 showed higher ligand-independent RET autophosphorylation compared with RET C634R and similar proliferation rates in cell models. Subcutaneous injection of \u0394898-901 NIH 3T3 cells in nude mice produced tumors of around 500 mm<sup>3</sup> in 2 weeks, similarly to RET C634R cells. Selpercatinib inhibited cell growth of Ba/F3 RET \u0394898-901 and RET C634R with a similar half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of approximately 3 nM. Vandetanib was five-fold less effective at inhibiting cell growth promoted by RET \u0394898-901 mutant (IC<sub>50</sub>, 564 nM) compared with RET C634R one (IC<sub>50</sub>, 91 nM). Cabozantinib efficiently inhibited Ba/F3 RET C634 proliferation (IC<sub>50</sub>, 25.9 nM), but was scarcely active in Ba/F3 RET 898-901 (IC<sub>50</sub> > 1,350 nM). D898_E901 <i>RET</i> deletion is a gain-of-function mutation and responds to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in MTC. RET \u0394898-901 mutant is sensitive to selpercatinib and vandetanib, and acquired resistance to selpercatinib may develop via RET-independent mechanisms.', '2': 'Lipoblastoma-like tumor (LLT) is a rare adipocytic neoplasm with a predilection for the vulva. Since 2002, <30 cases have been reported, characterizing it as an indolent tumor that may sometimes recur locally. Diagnosis can be challenging due to its rarity and morphologic overlap with other adipocytic tumors. Thus far, there are no specific molecular or immunohistochemical features to aid in the diagnosis of LLT. Recent case reports have described LLT arising at other sites, including the spermatic cord and gluteal region, suggesting wider anatomical distribution. We present a large series of LLT to further characterize its clinicopathologic and molecular features. Twenty-eight cases of LLT were retrieved from departmental and consult archives (including 8 from a prior series). The cohort comprised 28 patients (8 males, 20 females) with a median age of 28 years (range: 1-80 years). There were 17 primary LLT of the vulva. Other anatomical sites included the scrotum (n\\xa0= 3), spermatic cord (n\\xa0= 2), inguinal region (n\\xa0= 2), limbs (n\\xa0= 2), pelvis (n\\xa0= 1), and retroperitoneum (n\\xa0= 1). Median tumor size was 6.0 cm (range: 1.8-30.0 cm). The tumors had a lobulated architecture and were typically composed of adipocytes, lipoblasts, and spindle cells in a myxoid stroma with prominent thin-walled vessels. Using immunohistochemistry, a subset showed loss of Rb expression (12/23 of samples). Follow-up in 15 patients (median: 56 months) revealed 8 patients with local recurrence and 1 patient with metastases to the lung/pleura and breasts. Targeted DNA sequencing revealed a simple genomic profile with limited copy number alterations and low mutational burden. No alterations in RB1 were identified. The metastatic LLT showed concurrent pathogenic PIK3CA and MTOR activating mutations, both in the primary and in the lung/pleural metastasis; the latter also harbored TERT promoter mutation. One tumor had a pathogenic TSC1 mutation, and one tumor showed 2-copy deletion of CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and MTAP. No biologically significant variants were identified in 8 tumors. No gene fusions were identified by RNA sequencing in 4 tumors successfully sequenced. This study expands the clinicopathologic spectrum of LLT, highlighting its wider anatomical distribution and potential for occasional metastasis. Molecularly, we identified activating mutations in the PI3K-MTOR signaling pathway in 2 tumors, which may contribute to exceptional aggressive behavior.', '3': 'Homozygous deletion of <i>MTAP</i> upregulates <i>de novo</i> synthesis of purine (DNSP) and increases the proliferation of neoplastic cells. This increases the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to DNSP inhibitors such as methotrexate, L-alanosine and pemetrexed. 7,301 cases of MBC underwent hybrid-capture based comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP). Tumor mutational burden (TMB) was determined on up to 1.1 Mb of sequenced DNA and microsatellite instability (MSI) was determined on 114 loci. Tumor cell PD-L1 expression was determined by IHC (Dako 22C3). 208 (2.84%) of MBC featured <i>MTAP</i> loss. <i>MTAP</i> loss patients were younger (<i>p</i> = 0.002) and were more frequently ER- (30% vs. 50%; <i>p</i> < 0.0001), triple negative (TNBC) (47% vs. 27%; <i>p</i> < 0.0001) and less frequently HER2+ (2% vs. 8%; <i>p</i> = 0.0001) than <i>MTAP</i> intact MBC. Lobular histology and <i>CDH1</i> mutations were more frequent in <i>MTAP</i> intact (14%) than <i>MTAP</i> loss MBC (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). <i>CDKN2A</i> (100%) and <i>CDKN2B</i> (97%) loss (9p21 co-deletion) were significantly associated with <i>MTAP</i> loss (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). Likely associated with the increased TNBC cases, BRCA1 mutation was also more frequent in <i>MTAP</i> loss MBC (10% vs. 4%; <i>p</i> < 0.0001). As for immune checkpoint inhibitors biomarkers, higher TMB >20 mut/Mb levels in the <i>MTAP</i> intact MBC (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) and higher PD-L1 low expression (1-49% TPS) in the <i>MTAP</i> loss <i>MTAP</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.002) were observed. <i>MTAP</i> loss in MBC has distinct clinical features with genomic alterations (GA) affecting both targeted and immunotherapies. Further efforts are necessary to identify alternative means of targeting PRMT5 and MTA2 in <i>MTAP</i>-ve cancers to benefit from the high-MTA environment of <i>MTAP</i>-deficient cancers.', '4': \"Advanced urothelial carcinoma continues to have a dismal prognosis despite several new therapies in the last 5 years. <i>FGFR2</i> and <i>FGFR3</i> mutations and fusions, PD-L1 expression, tumor mutational burden, and microsatellite instability are established predictive biomarkers in advanced urothelial carcinoma. Novel biomarkers can optimize the sequencing of available treatments and improve outcomes. We describe herein the clinical and pathologic features of patients with an emerging subtype of bladder cancer characterized by deletion of the gene <i>MTAP</i> encoding the enzyme S-Methyl-5'-thioadenosine phosphatase, a potential biomarker of response to pemetrexed. We performed a retrospective analysis of 61 patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma for whom demographics, pathologic specimens, next generation sequencing, and clinical outcomes were available. We compared the frequency of histology variants, upper tract location, pathogenic gene variants, tumor response, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) between patients with tumors harboring <i>MTAP</i> deletion (<i>MTAP</i>-del) and wild type tumors (<i>MTAP</i>-WT). A propensity score matching of 5 covariates (age, gender, presence of variant histology, prior surgery, and prior non-muscle invasive bladder cancer) was calculated to compensate for disparity when comparing survival in these subgroups. Non-supervised clustering analysis of differentially expressed genes between <i>MTAP</i>-del and <i>MTAP</i>-WT urothelial carcinomas was performed. <i>MTAP</i>-del occurred in 19 patients (31%). Tumors with <i>MTAP</i>-del were characterized by higher prevalence of squamous differentiation (47.4 vs 11.9%), bone metastases (52.6 vs 23.5%) and lower frequency of upper urinary tract location (5.2% vs 26.1%). Pathway gene set enrichment analysis showed that among the genes upregulated in the <i>MTAP</i>-del cohort, at least 5 were linked to keratinization (FOXN1, KRT33A/B, KRT84, RPTN) possibly contributing to the higher prevalence of squamous differentiation. Alterations in the PIK3 and MAPK pathways were more frequent when <i>MTAP</i> was deleted. There was a trend to inferior response to chemotherapy among <i>MTAP</i>-del tumors, but no difference in the response to immune checkpoint inhibitors or enfortumab. Median progression free survival after first line therapy (PFS1) was 5.5 months for patients with <i>MTAP</i>-WT and 4.5 months for patients with <i>MTAP</i>-del (HR = 1.30; 95% CI, 0.64-2.63; P = 0.471). There was no difference in the time from metastatic diagnosis to death (P = 0.6346). Median OS from diagnosis of localized or de novo metastatic disease was 16 months (range 1.5-60, IQR 8-26) for patients with MTAP-del and 24.5 months (range 3-156, IQR 16-48) for patients with MTAP-WT (P = 0.0218), suggesting that time to progression to metastatic disease is shorter in MTAP-del patients. Covariates did not impact significantly overall survival on propensity score matching. In conclusion, MTAP -del occurs in approximately 30% of patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma and defines a subgroup of patients with aggressive features, such as squamous differentiation, frequent bone metastases, poor response to chemotherapy, and shorter time to progression to metastatic disease.\", '5': 'When urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) presents or progresses to chemo-refractory metastatic disease, the search for new therapeutic targets is paramount. Targeting protein arginine methyltransferase 5 accumulation in tumors with methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) genomic loss has been proposed as a new anti-tumor strategy. We evaluated the incidence of patients with MTAP loss and correlate to treatment-guiding targets and biomarkers. Two thousand six hundred eighty-three cases of advanced UCB underwent hybrid-capture based comprehensive genomic profiling using the FDA-approved F1CDx assay to evaluate all classes of genomic alterations (GA) among 324 genes. Tumor mutational burden was determined on at least 0.8 Mbp of sequenced DNA and microsatellite instability was determined on at least 95 loci. 650 (24%) of UCB featured MTAP loss mutations (MTAP-). The gene and age distributions were similar in MTAP intact (MTAP+) and MTAP- UCB. MTAP- UCB contained higher GA/tumor frequency than MTAP+ UCB likely reflecting the frequent co-deletions of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A/B. Of potential therapeutic targets, fibroblast growth factor receptor 3, and phosphatase and tensin homolog GA were more frequent in MTAP- UCB. In contrast, biomarkers of immunotherapy response, including higher frequencies of high tumor mutational burden and high programmed death-ligand 1 IHC staining, were observed in the MTAP+ UCB. When compared with MTAP+ UCB, MTAP- UCB differs in genomic signatures including an increase in potentially targetable alterations but a lower frequency of immunotherapy drug biomarkers. Thus, the genomic landscape in MTAP- UCB may play a role in the design of clinical trials incorporating combination treatment strategies when targeting protein arginine methyltransferase 5 in MTAP- tumors.', '6': \"5'-Methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) is a key enzyme in the methionine salvage pathway and has been reported to suppress tumorigenesis. The MTAP gene is located at 9p21, a chromosome region often deleted in breast cancer (BC). However, the clinical and biological significance of MTAP in BC is still unclear. Here, we reported that MTAP was frequently downregulated in 41% (35/85) of primary BCs and 89% (8/9) of BC cell lines. Low expression of MTAP was significantly correlated with a poor survival of BC patients (P=0.0334). Functional studies showed that MTAP was able to suppress both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> tumorigenic ability of BC cells, including migration, invasion, angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastasis in nude mice with orthotopic xenograft tumor of BC. Mechanistically, we found that downregulation of MTAP could increase the polyamine levels by activating ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). By treating the MTAP-repressing BC cells with specific ODC inhibitor Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) or treating the MTAP-overexpressing BC cells with additional putrescine, metastasis-promoting or -suppressing phenotype of these MTAP-manipulated cells was significantly reversed, respectively. Taken together, our data suggested that MTAP has a critical metastasis-suppressive role by tightly regulating ODC activity in BC cells, which may serve as a prominent novel therapeutic target for advanced breast cancer treatment.\", '7': 'Diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) bearing driver mutations of histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27M) are incurable brain tumors with unique epigenomes. Here, we generated a syngeneic H3K27M mouse model to study the amino acid metabolic dependencies of these tumors. H3K27M mutant cells were highly dependent on methionine. Interrogating the methionine cycle dependency through a short-interfering RNA screen identified the enzyme methionine adenosyltransferase 2A (MAT2A) as a critical vulnerability in these tumors. This vulnerability was not mediated through the canonical mechanism of MTAP deletion; instead, DMG cells have lower levels of MAT2A protein, which is mediated by negative feedback induced by the metabolite decarboxylated S-adenosyl methionine. Depletion of residual MAT2A induces global depletion of H3K36me3, a chromatin mark of transcriptional elongation perturbing oncogenic and developmental transcriptional programs. Moreover, methionine-restricted diets extended survival in multiple models of DMG in vivo. Collectively, our results suggest that MAT2A presents an exploitable therapeutic vulnerability in H3K27M gliomas.', '8': \"Genetic alterations in FGF/FGFR pathway are infrequent in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), with rare cases of quadruple wildtype GISTs harboring FGFR1 gene fusions and mutations. Additionally, FGF/FGFR overexpression was shown to promote drug resistance to kinase inhibitors in GISTs. However, FGFR gene fusions have not been directly implicated as a mechanism of drug resistance in GISTs. Herein, we report a patient presenting with a primary small bowel spindle cell GIST and concurrent peritoneal and liver metastases displaying an imatinib-sensitive KIT exon 11 in-frame deletion. After an initial 9-month benefit to imatinib, the patient experienced intraabdominal peritoneal recurrence owing to secondary KIT exon 13 missense mutation and FGFR4 amplification. Despite several additional rounds of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), the patient's disease progressed after 2\\u2009years and presented with multiple peritoneal and liver metastases, including one pericolonic mass harboring secondary KIT exon 18 missense mutation, and a concurrent transverse colonic mass with a FGFR2::TACC2 fusion and AKT2 amplification. All tumors, including primary and recurrent masses, harbored an MGA c.7272\\u2009T\\u2009>\\u2009G (p.Y2424*) nonsense mutation and CDKN2A/CDKN2B/MTAP deletions. The transcolonic mass showed elevated mitotic count (18/10 HPF), as well as significant decrease in CD117 and DOG1 expression, in contrast to all the other resistant nodules that displayed diffuse and strong CD117 and DOG1 immunostaining. The FGFR2::TACC2 fusion resulted from a 742\\u2009kb intrachromosomal inversion at the chr10q26.3 locus, leading to a fusion between exons 1-17 of FGFR2 and exons 7-17 TACC2, which preserves the extracellular and protein tyrosine kinase domains of FGFR2. We present the first report of a multidrug-resistant GIST patient who developed an FGFR2 gene fusion as a secondary genetic event to the selective pressure of various TKIs. This case also highlights the heterogeneous escape mechanisms to targeted therapy across various tumor nodules, spanning from both KIT-dependent and KIT-independent off-target activation pathways.\", '9': 'The overall survival of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains poor and its incidence is rising. Targetable mutations in PDAC are rare, thus novel therapeutic approaches are needed. Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) overexpression is associated with worse survival and inhibition of PRMT5 results in decreased cancer growth across multiple cancers, including PDAC. Emerging evidence also suggests that altered RNA processing is a driver in PDAC tumorigenesis and creates a partial dependency on this process. PRMT5 inhibition induces altered splicing and this vulnerability can be exploited as a novel therapeutic approach. Three possible biological pathways underpinning the action of PRMT5 inhibitors are discussed; c-Myc regulation appears central to its action in the PDAC setting. Whilst homozygous MTAP deletion and symmetrical dimethylation levels are associated with increased sensitivity to PRMT5 inhibition, neither measure robustly predicts its growth inhibitory response. The immunomodulatory effect of PRMT5 inhibitors on the tumour microenvironment will also be discussed, based on emerging evidence that PDAC stroma has a significant bearing on disease behaviour and response to therapy. Lastly, with the above caveats in mind, current knowledge gaps and the implications and rationales for PRMT5 inhibitor development in PDAC will be explored.'}, 'Publication Date': {'0': '2023-08-23', '1': 'Not available', '2': '2023-06-22', '3': '2023-03-11', '4': '2023-01-15', '5': '2022-11-25', '6': '2022-04-24', '7': '2022-04-14', '8': '2022-02-22', '9': '2021-10-13'}, 'DOI': {'0': '10.1007/s13577-023-00974-8', '1': '10.1200/PO.23.00052', '2': '10.1016/j.modpat.2023.100252', '3': '10.18632/oncotarget.28376', '4': 'Not available', '5': '10.1016/j.urolonc.2022.10.001', '6': '10.7150/ijbs.67149', '7': '10.1038/s43018-022-00348-3', '8': '10.1002/gcc.23030', '9': '10.3390/cancers13205136'}, 'Citation Counts': {'0': 1, '1': 0, '2': 0, '3': 0, '4': 2, '5': 4, '6': 5, '7': 6, '8': 3, '9': 7}, 'MeSH terms': {'0': '', '1': 'Animals, Mice, Humans, Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret, Mice, Nude, Thyroid Neoplasms, Piperidines, Fluorouracil, Dacarbazine', '2': '', '3': 'Humans, B7-H1 Antigen, Homozygote, Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms, Sequence Deletion, Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase, Genomics, Histone Deacetylases, Repressor Proteins, Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases', '4': '', '5': 'Humans, Carcinoma, Transitional Cell, Urinary Bladder Neoplasms, Synthetic Lethal Mutations, Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases, Genomics', '6': 'Animals, Breast Neoplasms, Down-Regulation, Female, Heterografts, Humans, Mice, Mice, Nude, Ornithine Decarboxylase, Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase', '7': 'Animals, Brain Neoplasms, Epigenome, Glioma, Histones, Methionine, Methionine Adenosyltransferase, Mice', '8': 'Antineoplastic Agents, Carrier Proteins, Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors, Gene Fusion, Humans, Imatinib Mesylate, Liver Neoplasms, Mutation, Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit, Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 2, Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha, Tumor Suppressor Proteins', '9': ''}}}, '14089': {'2297': {'Title': {'0': 'Genomic landscape of patients with germline RUNX1 variants and familial platelet disorder with myeloid malignancy.', '1': 'Intestinal-Type Adenocarcinoma in Head and Neck: Dissecting Oncogenic Gene Alterations Through Whole Transcriptome and Exome Analysis.', '2': 'Genomic Landscape of Patients with Germline <i>RUNX1</i> Variants and Familial Platelet Disorder with Myeloid Malignancy.', '3': 'The Identification by Exome Sequencing of Candidate Genes in <i>BRCA</i>-Negative Tunisian Patients at a High Risk of Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer.', '4': 'Identification of Altered Genes in Gallbladder Cancer as Potential Driver Mutations for Diagnostic and Prognostic Purposes: A Computational Approach.', '5': 'Gene alterations in epigenetic modifiers and JAK-STAT signaling are frequent in breast implant-associated ALCL.', '6': 'Genomic characterization of metastatic breast cancers.', '7': 'A knowledge-based framework for the discovery of cancer-predisposing variants using large-scale sequencing breast cancer data.'}, 'Authors': {'0': 'Kai Yu;

We recently launched a longitudinal natural history study for patients with FPDMM. Among 27 families with research genomic data by the end of 2021, 26 different germline RUNX1 variants were detected. Besides missense mutations enriched in Runt homology domain and loss-of-function mutations distributed throughout the gene, splice-region mutations and large deletions were detected in 6 and 7 families, respectively. In 25 of 51 (49%) patients without hematologic malignancy, somatic mutations were detected in at least 1 of the clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) genes or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) driver genes. BCOR was the most frequently mutated gene (in 9 patients), and multiple BCOR mutations were identified in 4 patients. Mutations in 6 other CHIP- or AML-driver genes (TET2, DNMT3A, KRAS, LRP1B, IDH1, and KMT2C) were also found in \u22652 patients without hematologic malignancy. Moreover, 3 unrelated patients (1 with myeloid malignancy) carried somatic mutations in NFE2, which regulates erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation. Sequential sequencing data from 19 patients demonstrated dynamic changes of somatic mutations over time, and stable clones were more frequently found in older adult patients. In summary, there are diverse types of germline RUNX1 mutations and high frequency of somatic mutations related to clonal hematopoiesis in patients with FPDMM. Monitoring changes in somatic mutations and clinical manifestations prospectively may reveal mechanisms for malignant progression and inform clinical management. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT03854318.', '1': 'Adenocarcinomas of the nasal/paranasal sinuses are uncommon, but intestinal-type adenocarcinomas (ITACs) are important. Due to the rarity of these tumors, their molecular profile is not well known. To further investigate the molecular profile and find potential oncogenic drivers, we compared the whole transcriptome and exome of ITACs at different anatomic locations in the head and neck. Twenty-one head and neck adenocarcinomas were used in this study, divided into 10 sinonasal adenocarcinomas (SNT) and 11 extrasinonasal (T) head and neck adenocarcinomas according to anatomic location and histology. Tumor samples along with normal mucosa were microdissected from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples, and RNA and DNA were subjected to whole-transcriptome and -exome shotgun sequencing. Analysis of ITACs at sinonasal locations showed 410 subtype-specific differentially expressed (DE) genes and noncoding transcripts compared with the group of other anatomic locations, with 2909 subtype-specific DE genes. The groups shared 872 genes, with 17 highly different or opposing DE genes. Whole-exome mutation analysis revealed the gene MLL3 (KMT2C) to be exhibiting the most frequent loss-of-function mutations in all adenocarcinomas investigated. The results suggest that the head and neck ITACs investigated were mainly caused by loss-of-function mutations in MLL3 that disabled chromatin methylation and remodeling of all MLL3-targeted enhancers in the tumors. This changed the activity of multiple genes/gene clusters, supporting oncogenicity mostly via pathways of signaling, dedifferentiation, proliferation, migration, and immune and inflammatory deregulation, indicating a truly epigenetic event as the root cause for the heterogenous diversity of these enteric types of cancer. The data of this study form the basis for understanding cell fate determination and cellular homeostasis in the normal respiratory mucosa at different anatomic sites and show the contribution of different mucosal components to the etiology/molecular pathology of ITAC.', '2': 'Germline <i>RUNX1</i> mutations lead to familial platelet disorder with associated myeloid malignancies (FPDMM), which is characterized by thrombocytopenia and a life-long risk (35-45%) of hematological malignancies. We recently launched a longitudinal natural history study for patients with FPDMM at the NIH Clinical Center. Among 29 families with research genomic data, 28 different germline <i>RUNX1</i> variants were detected. Besides missense mutations enriched in Runt homology domain and loss-of-function mutations distributed throughout the gene, splice-region mutations and large deletions were detected in 6 and 7 families, respectively.

Comprehensive genomic profile of patients with FPDMM with germline <i>RUNX1</i> mutations. Rising clonal hematopoiesis related secondary mutations that may lead to myeloid malignancies.', '3': '(1) Background: Germline variants in <i>BRCA1/BRCA2</i> genes explain about 20% of hereditary breast/ovarian cancer (HBOC) cases. In the present paper, we aim to identify genetic determinants in <i>BRCA</i>-negative families from the South of Tunisia. (2) Methods: Exome Sequencing (ES) was performed on the lymphocyte DNA of patients negative for <i>BRCA</i> mutations from each Tunisian family with a high risk of HBOC. (3) Results: We focus on the canonical genes associated with HBOC and identified missense variants in DNA damage response genes, such as <i>ATM</i>, <i>RAD52</i>, and <i>RAD54</i>; however, no variants in <i>PALB2</i>, <i>Chek2</i>, and <i>TP53</i> genes were found. To identify novel candidate genes, we selected variants harboring a loss of function and identified 17 stop-gain and 11 frameshift variants in genes not commonly known to be predisposed to HBOC. Then, we focus on rare and high-impact genes shared by at least 3 unrelated patients from each family and selected 16 gene variants. Through combined data analysis from MCODE with gene ontology and KEGG pathways, a short list of eight candidate genes (<i>ATM</i>, <i>EP300</i>, <i>LAMA1</i>, <i>LAMC2</i>, <i>TNNI3</i>, <i>MYLK</i>, <i>COL11A2</i>, and <i>LAMB3</i>) was created. The impact of the 24 selected genes on survival was analyzed using the TCGA data resulting in a selection of five candidate genes (<i>EP300</i>, <i>KMT2C</i>, <i>RHPN2</i>, <i>HSPG2</i>, and <i>CCR3)</i> that showed a significant association with survival. (4) Conclusions: We identify novel candidate genes predisposed to HBOC that need to be validated in larger cohorts and investigated by analyzing the co-segregation of selected variants in affected families and the locus-specific loss of heterozygosity to highlight their relevance for HBOC risk.', '4': 'Prognostic markers for cancer can assist in the evaluation of survival probability of patients and help clinicians to assess the available treatment modalities. Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is a rare tumor that causes 165\\u2009087 deaths in the world annually. It is the most common cancer of the biliary tract and has a particularly high incidence in Chile, Japan, and northern India. Currently, there is no accurate diagnosis test or effective molecular markers for GBC identification. Several studies have focused on the discovery of genetic alterations in important genes associated with GBC to propose novel diagnosis pathways and to create prognostic profiles. To achieve this, we performed data-mining of GBC in public repositories, harboring 133 samples of GBC, allowing us to describe relevant somatic mutations in important genes and to propose a genetic alteration atlas for GBC. In our results, we reported the 14 most altered genes in GBC: <i>arid1a, arid2, atm, ctnnb1, erbb2, erbb3, kmt2c, kmt2d, kras, pik3ca, smad4, tert, tp53</i>, and <i>znf521</i> in samples from Japan, the United States, Chile, and China. Missense mutations are common among these genes. The annotations of many mutations revealed their importance in cancer development. The observed annotations mentioned that several mutations found in this repository are probably oncogenic, with a putative loss-of-function. In addition, they are hotspot mutations and are probably linked to poor prognosis in other cancers. We identified another 11 genes, which presented a copy number alteration in gallbladder database samples, which are <i>ccnd1, ccnd3, ccne1, cdk12, cdkn2a, cdkn2b, erbb2, erbb3, kras, mdm2</i>, and <i>myc</i>. The findings reported here can help to detect GBC cancer through the development of systems based on genetic alterations, for example, the development of a mutation panel specifically for GBC diagnosis, as well as the creation of prognostic profiles to accomplish the development of GBC and its prevalence.', '5': 'The oncogenic events involved in breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BI-ALCL) remain elusive. To clarify this point, we have characterized the genomic landscape of 34 BI-ALCLs (15 tumor and 19 in situ subtypes) collected from 54 BI-ALCL patients diagnosed through the French Lymphopath network. Whole-exome sequencing (n = 22, with paired tumor/germline DNA) and/or targeted deep sequencing (n = 24) showed recurrent mutations of epigenetic modifiers in 74% of cases, involving notably KMT2C (26%), KMT2D (9%), CHD2 (15%), and CREBBP (15%). KMT2D and KMT2C mutations correlated with a loss of H3K4 mono- and trimethylation by immunohistochemistry. Twenty cases (59%) showed mutations in \u22651 member of the JAK/STAT pathway, including STAT3 (38%), JAK1 (18%), and STAT5B (3%), and in negative regulators, including SOCS3 (6%), SOCS1 (3%), and PTPN1 (3%). These mutations were more frequent in tumor-type samples than in situ samples (P = .038). All BI-ALCLs expressed pSTAT3, regardless of the mutational status of genes in the JAK/STAT pathway. Mutations in the EOMES gene (12%) involved in lymphocyte development, PI3K-AKT/mTOR (6%), and loss-of-function mutations in TP53 (12%) were also identified. Copy-number aberration (CNA) analysis identified recurrent alterations, including gains on chromosomes 2, 9p, 12p, and 21 and losses on 4q, 8p, 15, 16, and 20. Regions of CNA encompassed genes involved in the JAK/STAT pathway and epigenetic regulators. Our results show that the BI-ALCL genomic landscape is characterized by not only JAK/STAT activating mutations but also loss-of-function alterations of epigenetic modifiers.', '6': 'Metastasis is the main cause of death for patients with breast cancer. Many studies have characterized the genomic landscape of breast cancer during its early stages. However, there is evidence that genomic alterations are acquired during the evolution of cancers from their early to late stages, and that the genomic landscape of early cancers is not representative of that of lethal cancers<sup>1-7</sup>. Here we investigated the landscape of somatic alterations in 617 metastatic breast cancers. Nine driver genes (TP53, ESR1, GATA3, KMT2C, NCOR1, AKT1, NF1, RIC8A and RB1) were more frequently mutated in metastatic breast cancers that expressed hormone receptors (oestrogen and/or progesterone receptors; HR<sup>+</sup>) but did not have high levels of HER2 (HER2<sup>-</sup>; n\\xa0=\\xa0381), when compared to early breast cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas. In addition, 18 amplicons were more frequently observed in HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>-</sup> metastatic breast cancers. These cancers showed an increase in mutational signatures S2, S3, S10, S13 and S17. Among the gene alterations that were enriched in HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>-</sup> metastatic breast cancers, mutations in TP53, RB1 and NF1, together with S10, S13 and S17, were associated with poor outcome. Metastatic triple-negative breast cancers showed an increase in the frequency of somatic biallelic loss-of-function mutations in genes related to homologous recombination DNA repair, compared to early triple-negative breast cancers (7% versus 2%). Finally, metastatic breast cancers showed an increase in mutational burden and clonal diversity compared to early breast cancers. Thus, the genomic landscape of metastatic breast cancer is enriched in clinically relevant genomic alterations and is more complex than that of early breast cancer. The identification of genomic alterations associated with poor outcome will allow earlier and better selection of patients who require the use of treatments that are still in clinical trials. The genetic complexity observed in advanced breast cancer suggests that such treatments should be introduced as early as possible in the disease course.', '7': 'The landscape of cancer-predisposing genes has been extensively investigated in the last 30\\xa0years with various methodologies ranging from candidate gene to genome-wide association studies. However, sequencing data are still poorly exploited in cancer predisposition studies due to the lack of statistical power when comparing millions of variants at once. To overcome these power limitations, we propose a knowledge-based framework founded on the characteristics of known cancer-predisposing variants and genes. Under our framework, we took advantage of a combination of previously generated datasets of sequencing experiments to identify novel breast cancer-predisposing variants, comparing the normal genomes of 673 breast cancer patients of European origin against 27,173 controls matched by ethnicity. We detected several expected variants on known breast cancer-predisposing genes, like BRCA1 and BRCA2, and 11 variants on genes associated with other cancer types, like RET and AKT1. Furthermore, we detected 183 variants that overlap with somatic mutations in cancer and 41 variants associated with 38 possible loss-of-function genes, including PIK3CB and KMT2C. Finally, we found a set of 19 variants that are potentially pathogenic, negatively correlate with age at onset, and have never been associated with breast cancer. In this study, we demonstrate the usefulness of a genomic-driven approach nested in a classic case-control study to prioritize cancer-predisposing variants. In addition, we provide a resource containing variants that may affect susceptibility to breast cancer.'}, 'Publication Date': {'0': 'Not available', '1': '2023-10-31', '2': '2023-01-17', '3': '2022-07-22', '4': '2020-05-25', '5': 'Not available', '6': '2019-05-22', '7': '2017-05-31'}, 'DOI': {'0': '10.1182/bloodadvances.2023011165', '1': '10.1016/j.modpat.2023.100372', '2': '10.1101/2023.01.17.524290', '3': '10.3390/genes13081296', '4': '10.1177/1176935120922154', '5': '10.1182/blood.2019001904', '6': '10.1038/s41586-019-1056-z', '7': '10.1186/s13058-017-0854-1'}, 'Citation Counts': {'0': 0, '1': 0, '2': 0, '3': 1, '4': 10, '5': 61, '6': 290, '7': 1}, 'MeSH terms': {'0': 'Humans, Aged, Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Myeloproliferative Disorders, Hematologic Neoplasms, Genomics, Germ Cells, Blood Platelet Disorders, Blood Coagulation Disorders, Inherited', '1': 'Humans, Exome, Transcriptome, Biomarkers, Tumor, Adenocarcinoma, Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms', '2': '', '3': 'Breast Neoplasms, Exome, Female, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Humans, Ovarian Neoplasms, Exome Sequencing', '4': '', '5': 'Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Breast Implants, DNA Copy Number Variations, Epigenesis, Genetic, Female, Genome, Human, Humans, Janus Kinases, Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Anaplastic, Middle Aged, Mutation, STAT Transcription Factors, Signal Transduction', '6': 'Breast Neoplasms, DNA Mutational Analysis, Disease Progression, Evolution, Molecular, Female, Genome, Human, Genomics, Humans, Male, Mutation, Neoplasm Metastasis, Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms', '7': 'Age Factors, Alleles, Biomarkers, Tumor, Breast Neoplasms, Case-Control Studies, Epistasis, Genetic, Female, Gene Frequency, Genes, BRCA1, Genes, BRCA2, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Genetic Variation, Genome-Wide Association Study, Genotype, Germ-Line Mutation, Humans, Male, Multifactorial Inheritance, Mutation, Workflow'}}}}",
